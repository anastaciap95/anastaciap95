impairment or subjective cognitive decline from the Swedish BioFINDER (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) cohort (recruited from September 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014) who had undergone flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flutemetamol)–labeled PET.\n","NEITHER    Levels of CSF Aβ42 were analyzed using the classic INNOTEST and the newer modified INNOTEST,

Results Of 262 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [5.5] years), 108 were women (41.2%) and 154 were men (58.8%).\n","EVIDENCE   The mass spectrometry–derived Aβ42 values showed higher correlations with the modified Aβ42-INNOTEST (r = 0.97), Aβ42-FL (r = 0.93), Aβ42-EI (r = 0.93), and Aβ42-MSD (r = 0.95) assays compared with the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay (r = 0.88;P ≤ .01).\n","EVIDENCE   The

of CSF Aβ42 derived from the new immunoassays (modified INNOTEST, FL, EI, and MSD) may correlate better with the antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure and may

Between Different Amyloid Immunoassays and Visual Amyloid Positron Emission Tomographic Assessment Importance Visual assessment of amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) images has been approved by regulatory authorities for clinical use. Several immunoassays have been developed to measure β-amyloid (Aβ) 42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The agreement between CSF Aβ42 measures from different immunoassays and visual PET readings may influence the use of CSF biomarkers and/or amyloid PET assessment in clinical practice and trials. Objective To determine the concordance between CSF Aβ42 levels measured using 5 different immunoassays and visual amyloid PET analysis. Design, Setting, and Participants The study included 262 patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline from the Swedish BioFINDER (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) cohort (recruited from September 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014) who had undergone flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flutemetamol)–labeled PET. Levels of CSF Aβ42 were analyzed using the classic INNOTEST and the newer modified INNOTEST, fully automated Lumipulse (FL), EUROIMMUN (EI), and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays. Concentrations of CSF Aβ were assessed using an antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure. Main Outcomes and Measures The concordance of CSF Aβ42 levels and Aβ42:Aβ40 and Aβ42:tau ratios with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status. Results Of 262 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [5.5] years), 108 were women (41.2%) and 154 were men (58.8%). The mass spectrometry–derived Aβ42 values showed higher correlations with the modified Aβ42-INNOTEST (r\\u2009=\\u20090.97), Aβ42-FL (r\\u2009=\\u20090.93), Aβ42-EI (r\\u2009=\\u20090.93), and Aβ42-MSD (r\\u2009=\\u20090.95) assays compared with the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay (r\\u2009=\\u20090.88;P\\u2009≤\\u2009.01). The signal in the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay was partly quenched by recombinant Aβ1-40 peptide. However, the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay showed better concordance with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.92) compared with the newer assays (AUCs, 0.87-0.89;P\\u2009≤\\u2009.01). The accuracies of the newer assays improved significantly when Aβ42:Aβ40 (AUCs, 0.93-0.95;P\\u2009≤\\u2009.01), Aβ42 to total tau (T-tau) (AUCs, 0.94;P\\u2009≤\\u2009.05), or Aβ42 to phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (AUCs, 0.94-0.95;P\\u2009≤\\u2009.001) ratios were used. A combination of the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and T-tau or P-tau level did not improve the accuracy compared with the ratio alone. Conclusions and Relevance Concentrations of CSF Aβ42 derived from the new immunoassays (modified INNOTEST, FL, EI, and MSD) may correlate better with the antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure and may show improved agreement with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET assessment when using the Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios. These findings suggest the benefit of implementing the CSF Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios as a biomarker of amyloid deposition in clinical practice and trials. Association of Changes in Plasma Neurofilament Light and Tau Levels With Anesthesia and Surgery Importance Anesthesia and surgery are believed to act on the central nervous system by a fully reversible mechanism innocuous to nerve cells. Evidence that neurological sequelae may follow would challenge this belief and would thereby suggest a need to reassess theories of the mechanism of anesthetic action or the response of the central nervous system to surgery. Objective To measure 2 biomarkers of neurological injury (neurofilament light and tau) in plasma in a series of timed collections before and after anesthesia and surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants These 2 related observational studies (CAPACITY and ARCADIAN) recruited patients 60 years and older who were undergoing general anesthesia for surgeries performed within a tertiary hospital. Blood samples were taken immediately before surgical anesthesia was administered and then sequentially after surgery at 30-minute, 6-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour intervals. Sampling took place from January 2014 to August 2015. Data analysis took place from October 2016 to February 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Plasma neurofilament light and tau. Results A total of 30 patients were enrolled (13 from the CAPACITY study and 17 from the ARCADIAN study). The mean (SD) age was 69.1 (7.0) years, and 18 members (59%) of the participant group were female; 22 (73%) were undergoing joint arthroplasty. Mean neurofilament light increased at each measurement from a combined baseline mean (SD) of 22.3 (20.4) pg/mL to a maximal combined mean (SD) level of 35.1 (28.7) pg/mL, a maximum increase of 67% (95% CI, 45%-89%;P\\u2009 Conclusions and Relevance Neurofilament light is a specific marker of axonal injury and has been shown to indicate neuronal damage in a number of diseases. Tau proteins are an integral component of axonal integrity, and increased tau indicates neuronal damage. The increases in both neurofilament light and tau over 48 hours after surgery suggest that general anesthesia and surgery may be associated with neuronal damage in the short term. Further investigations will be required to study any association with clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings demand that we question the prevailing assumption that anesthesia and surgery are innocuous, transient, and without injurious changes to the central nervous system. Dynamically triggered slip leading to sustained fault gouge weakening under laboratory shear conditions We investigate dynamic wave-triggered slip under laboratory shear conditions. The experiment is composed of a three-block system containing two gouge layers composed of glass beads and held in place by a fixed load in a biaxial configuration. When the system is sheared under steady state conditions at a normal load of 4\\u2009MPa, we find that shear failure may be instantaneously triggered by a dynamic wave, corresponding to material weakening and softening if the system is in a critical shear stress state (near failure). Following triggering, the gouge material remains in a perturbed state over multiple slip cycles as evidenced by the recovery of the material strength, shear modulus, and slip recurrence time. This work suggests that faults must be critically stressed to trigger under dynamic conditions and that the recovery process following a dynamically triggered event differs from the recovery following a spontaneous event. Impacts of parameterized orographic drag on the\\n            N\\n            orthern\\n            H\\n            emisphere winter circulation Abstract A recent intercomparison exercise proposed by the Working Group for Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) revealed that the parameterized, or unresolved, surface stress in weather forecast models is highly model‐dependent, especially over orography. Models of comparable resolution differ over land by as much as 20% in zonal mean total subgrid surface stress (τtot). The way τtot is partitioned between the different parameterizations is also model‐dependent. In this study, we simulated in a particular model an increase in τtot comparable with the spread found in the WGNE intercomparison. This increase was simulated in two ways, namely by increasing independently the contributions to τtot of the turbulent orographic form drag scheme (TOFD) and of the orographic low‐level blocking scheme (BLOCK). Increasing the parameterized orographic drag leads to significant changes in surface pressure, zonal wind and temperature in the Northern Hemisphere during winter both in 10 day weather forecasts and in seasonal integrations. However, the magnitude of these changes in circulation strongly depends on which scheme is modified. In 10 day forecasts, stronger changes are found when the TOFD stress is increased, while on seasonal time scales the effects are of comparable magnitude, although different in detail. At these time scales, the BLOCK scheme affects the lower stratosphere winds through changes in the resolved planetary waves which are associated with surface impacts, while the TOFD effects are mostly limited to the lower troposphere. The partitioning of τtot between the two schemes appears to play an important role at all time scales. Climate model biases in jet streams, blocking and storm tracks resulting from missing orographic drag State-of-the art climate models generally struggle to represent important features of the large-scale circulation. Common model deficiencies include an equatorward bias in the location of the midlatitude westerlies and an overly zonal orientation of the North Atlantic storm track. Orography is known to strongly affect the atmospheric circulation and is notoriously difficult to represent in coarse-resolution climate models. Yet how the representation of orography affects circulation biases in current climate models is not understood. Here we show that the effects of switching off the parameterization of drag from low-level orographic blocking in one climate model resemble the biases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble: An overly zonal wintertime North Atlantic storm track and less European blocking events, and an equatorward shift in the Southern Hemispheric jet and increase in the\\\\ud Southern Annular Mode time scale. This suggests that typical circulation biases in coarse-resolution climate models may be alleviated by improved parameterizations of low-level drag. On the evolution of elastic properties during laboratory stick-slip experiments spanning the transition from slow slip to dynamic rupture The physical mechanisms governing slow earthquakes remain unknown, as does the relationship between slow and regular earthquakes. To investigate the mechanism(s) of slow earthquakes and related quasi-dynamic modes of fault slip we performed laboratory experiments on simulated fault gouge in the double direct shear configuration. We reproduced the full spectrum of slip behavior, from slow to fast stick slip, by altering the elastic stiffness of the loading apparatus (k) to match the critical rheologic stiffness of fault gouge (kc). Our experiments show an evolution from stable sliding, when k\\u2009>\\u2009kc, to quasi-dynamic transients when k\\u2009~\\u2009kc, to dynamic instabilities when k\\u2009<\\u2009kc. To evaluate the microphysical processes of fault weakening we monitored variations of elastic properties. We find systematic changes in P wave velocity (Vp) for laboratory seismic cycles. During the coseismic stress drop, seismic velocity drops abruptly, consistent with observations on natural faults. In the preparatory phase preceding failure, we find that accelerated fault creep causes a Vp reduction for the complete spectrum of slip behaviors. Our results suggest that the mechanics of slow and fast ruptures share key features and that they can occur on same faults, depending on frictional properties. In agreement with seismic surveys on tectonic faults our data show that their state of stress can be monitored by Vp changes during the seismic cycle. The observed reduction in Vp during the earthquake preparatory phase suggests that if similar mechanisms are confirmed in nature high-resolution monitoring of fault zone properties may be a promising avenue for reliable detection of earthquake precursors. Select strengths and biases of models in representing the Arctic winter boundary layer over sea ice: the Larcform 1 single column model intercomparison Weather and climate models struggle to represent lower tropospheric temperature and moisture profiles and surface fluxes in Arctic winter, partly because they lack or misrepresent physical processes that are specific to high latitudes. Observations have revealed two preferred states of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water limits surface radiative cooling, and temperature inversions are weak and elevated. In the radiatively clear state, strong surface radiative cooling leads to the build‐up of surface‐based temperature inversions. Many large‐scale models lack the cloudy state, and some substantially underestimate inversion strength in the clear state. Here, the transformation from a moist to a cold dry air mass is modeled using an idealized Lagrangian perspective. The trajectory includes both boundary layer states, and the single‐column experiment is the first Lagrangian Arctic air formation experiment (Larcform 1) organized within GEWEX GASS (Global atmospheric system studies). The intercomparison reproduces the typical biases of large‐scale models: some models lack the cloudy state of the boundary layer due to the representation of mixed‐phase microphysics or to the interaction between micro‐ and macrophysics. In some models, high emissivities of ice clouds or the lack of an insulating snow layer prevent the build‐up of surface‐based inversions in the radiatively clear state. Models substantially disagree on the amount of cloud liquid water in the cloudy state and on turbulent heat fluxes under clear skies. Observations of air mass transformations including both boundary layer states would allow for a tighter constraint of model behavior. ISSN:1942-2466 Is Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody-Positive Rheumatoid Arthritis Still a More Severe Disease Than Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody-Negative Rheumatoid Arthritis? A Longitudinal Cohort Study in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Diagnosed From 2000 Onwar Objective Because of its association with joint destruction, anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)–positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered to be more severe than ACPA‐negative RA. Clinically relevant joint destruction is now infrequent thanks to adequate disease suppression. According to patients, important outcomes are pain, fatigue, and independence. We evaluated whether ACPA‐positive RA patients diagnosed during or after 2000 have more severe self‐reported limitations and impairments, including restrictions at work, than ACPA‐negative RA patients. Methods A total of 492 ACPA‐positive and 450 ACPA‐negative RA patients who fulfilled the 2010 criteria and were included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic cohort during or after 2000 were compared for self‐reported pain, fatigue, disease activity, general well‐being (measured by numerical rating scales), physical function (measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire), and work restrictions, including absenteeism at baseline and during the 4‐year followup. Linear mixed models were used. Results At disease presentation, ACPA‐negative patients had more severe pain, fatigue, self‐reported disease activity scores, and functional disability (P < 0.05), although absolute differences were small. During followup, ACPA‐negative patients remained somewhat more fatigued (P = 0.002), whereas other patient‐reported impairments and limitations were similar. Thirty‐eight percent of ACPA‐negative and 48% of ACPA‐positive patients reported absenteeism (P = 0.30), with median 4 days missed in both groups in the last 3 months. Also, restrictions at work among employed patients and restrictions with household work were not statistically different at baseline and during followup. Conclusion In current rheumatology practice, ACPA‐positive RA is not more severe than ACPA‐negative RA in terms of patients’ relevant outcomes, including physical functioning and restrictions at work. This implies that efforts to further improve the disease course should be proportional to both disease subsets. Pump–Push–Probe for Ultrafast All‐Optical Switching: The Case of a Nanographene Molecule In the last two decades, the three-beams pump-push-probe (PPP) technique has become a well-established tool for investigating the multidimensional configurational space of a molecule, as it permits to disclose precious information about the multiple and often complex deactivation pathways of the excited molecule. From the spectroscopic point of view, such a tool has revealed details about the efficiency of charge pairs generation and conformational relaxation in p-conjugated molecules and macromolecules. In addition, PPP has been effectively utilised for modulating the gain signal in conjugated materials by taking advantage of the spectral overlap between stimulated emission and charge absorption in those systems. However, the relatively low stability of conjugated polymers under intense photoexcitation has been a crucial limitation for their real employment in plastic optical fibres (POFs) and for signal control applications. Here, we highlight the role of PPP for achieving ultrafast all-optical switching in p-conjugated systems. Furthermore, we report new experimental data on optical switching of a newly synthesised graphene molecule, namely dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBOV). The superior environmental and photostability of DBOV and, in general, of graphene nanostructures can represent a great advantage for their effective applications in POFs and information and communications technology. Self-Assembly of an Amphiphilic π-Conjugated Dyad into Fibers: Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Humidity Sensor The self-assembly of an amphiphilic monomolecular electron acceptor-donor dyad into electroactive π-π stacked fibrillar structures can be triggered by irradiation with visible light. These fibers, exposing hydrophilic ethylene glycol in their external shell, show unique characteristics as resistive humidity sensors that exhibit high sensitivity and ultrafast response. Direct Patterning of Organic Functional Polymers through Conventional Photolithography and Noninvasive Cross-Link Agents A new technique for direct patterning of functional organic polymers using commercial photolithography setups with a minimal loss of the materials\\' performances is reported. This result is achieved through novel cross-link agents made by boron- and fluorine-containing heterocycles that can react between themselves upon UV- and white-light exposure. Light-Modulation of the Charge Injection in a Polymer Thin-Film Transistor by Functionalizing the Electrodes with Bistable Photochromic Self-Assembled Monolayers High fatigue resistance, bistability, and drastic property changes among isomers allow efficient modulation of the current output of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) to be obtained by a photogating of the charge-injection mechanism. Reversible, Fast, and Wide-Range Oxygen Sensor Based on Nanostructured Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanostructured materials characterized by high surface-volume ratio hold the promise to constitute the active materials for next-generation sensors. Solution-processed hybrid organohalide perovskites, which have been extensively used in the last few years for optoelectronic applications, are characterized by a self-assembled nanostructured morphology, which makes them an ideal candidate for gas sensing. Hitherto, detailed studies of the dependence of their electrical characteristics on the environmental atmosphere have not been performed, and even the effect of a ubiquitous gas such as O2 has been widely overlooked. Here, the electrical response of organohalide perovskites to oxygen is studied. Surprisingly, a colossal increase (3000-fold) in the resistance of perovskite-based lateral devices is found when measured in a full oxygen atmosphere, which is ascribed to a trap healing mechanism originating from an O2 -mediated iodine vacancies filling. A variation as small as 70 ppm in the oxygen concentration can be detected. The effect is fast (<400 ms) and fully reversible, making organohalide perovskites ideal active materials for oxygen sensing. The effect of oxygen on the electrical characteristics of organohalide perovskites must be taken into deep consideration for the design and optimization of any other perovskite-based (opto-) electronic device working in ambient conditions. Self-Suspended Nanomesh Scaffold for Ultrafast Flexible Photodetectors Based on Organic Semiconducting Crystals Self-standing nanostructures are of fundamental interest in materials science and nanoscience and are widely used in (opto-)electronic and photonic devices as well as in micro-electromechanical systems. To date, large-area and self-standing nanoelectrode arrays assembled on flexible substrates have not been reported. Here the fabrication of a hollow nanomesh scaffold on glass and plastic substrates with a large surface area over 1 mm2 and ultralow leakage current density (≈1-10 pA mm-2 @ 2 V) across the empty scaffold is demonstrated. Thanks to the continuous sub-micrometer space formed in between the nanomesh and the bottom electrode, highly crystalline and dendritic domains of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethinyl)pentacene growing within the hollow cavity can be observed. The high degree of order at the supramolecular level leads to efficient charge and exciton transport; the photovoltaic detector supported on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates exhibits an ultrafast photoresponse time as short as 8 ns and a signal-to-noise ratio approaching 105 . Such a hollow scaffold holds great potential as a novel device architecture toward flexible (opto-)electronic applications based on self-assembled micro/nanocrystals. Photophysical Pathways in Highly Sensitive Cs2AgBiBr6Double-Perovskite Single-Crystal X-Ray Detectors The sensitive detection of X-rays embodies an important research area, being motivated by a common desire to minimize the radiation doses required for detection. Among metal halide perovskites, the double-perovskite Cs2 AgBiBr6 system has emerged as a promising candidate for the detection of X-rays, capable of high X-ray stability and sensitivity (105 μC Gy-1 cm-2 ). Herein, the important photophysical pathways in single-crystal Cs2 AgBiBr6 are detailed at both room (RT) and liquid-nitrogen (LN2 T) temperatures, with emphasis made toward understanding the carrier dynamics that influence X-ray sensitivity. This study draws upon several optical probes and an RT excitation model is developed which is far from optimal, being plagued by a large trap density and fast free-carrier recombination pathways. Substantially improved operating conditions are revealed at 77 K, with a long fundamental carrier lifetime (>1.5 µs) and a marked depopulation of parasitic recombination pathways. The temperature dependence of a single-crystal Cs2 AgBiBr6 X-ray detecting device is characterized and a strong and monotonic enhancement to the X-ray sensitivity upon cooling is demonstrated, moving from 316 μC Gy-1 cm-2 at RT to 988 μC Gy-1 cm-2 near LN2 T. It is concluded that even modest cooling-via a Peltier device-will facilitate a substantial enhancement in device performance, ultimately lowering the radiation doses required. ispartof: ADVANCED MATERIALS vol:30 issue:46 ispartof: location:Germany status: published A New Pathology in the Simulation of Chaotic Dynamical Systems on Digital Computers Systematic distortions are uncovered in the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems when represented and simulated on digital computers using standard IEEE floating‐point numbers. This is done by studying a model chaotic dynamical system with a single free parameter β, known as the generalized Bernoulli map, many of whose exact properties are known. Much of the structure of the dynamical system is lost in the floating‐point representation. For even integer values of the parameter, the long time behaviour is completely wrong, subsuming the known anomalous behaviour for β = 2. For non‐integer β, relative errors in observables can reach 14%. For odd integer values of β, floating‐point results are more accurate, but still produce relative errors two orders of magnitude larger than those attributable to roundoff. The analysis indicates that the pathology described, which cannot be mitigated by increasing the precision of the floating point numbers, is a representative example of a deeper problem in the computation of expectation values for chaotic systems. The findings sound a warning about the uncritical application of numerical methods in studies of the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, such as are routinely performed throughout computational science, including turbulence and molecular dynamics. Self-Assembly of Functionalized Oligothiophene into Hygroscopic Fibers: Fabrication of Highly Sensitive and Fast Humidity Sensors A new symmetric oligothiophene exposing tetraethylene glycol (TEG)-based side-chains is designed and synthesized. This molecule is found to self-assemble in solution forming supramolecular fibers, via π–π stacking between the conjugated oligothiophene backbones, which are phase segregated on the sub-nanometer scale from the TEG side-groups. The delocalization of the charges through the oligothiophene π–π stack ensures efficient charge transport while the hygroscopic shell, decorating the surface of the fibrillar structures, determines a certain affinity for polar molecules. Upon exposure to humidity, under environmental conditions, such supramolecular architectures are capable of reversibly absorbing and desorbing water molecules. Absorption of water molecules, due to increased environmental humidity, causes a fast and reproducible increase of the electrical current through the fibers by a factor 100 from 15% to 90% relative humidity, as measured in 2-terminal devices. Such process is extremely fast, taking place in less than 45 ms. The humidity-responsive characteristics of the presented oligothiophene-based fibers can be exploited for the facile fabrication of high-performances and solution-processable electrical resistive humidity sensors. A Bacterial Photosynthetic Enzymatic Unit Modulating Organic Transistors with Light The photochemical core of every photosynthetic apparatus is the reaction center, a transmembrane enzyme that converts photons into charge-separated states across the biological membrane with an almost unitary quantum yield. A light-responsive organic transistor architecture, which converts light into electrical current by exploiting the efficiency of this biological machinery, is presented. Proper surface tailoring enables the integration of the bacterial reaction center as photoactive element in organic transistors, allowing the transduction of its photogenerated voltage into photomodulation of the output current up to two orders of magnitude. This device architecture, termed light-responsive electrolyte-gated organic transistor, is the prototype of a new generation of low-power hybrid bio-optoelectronic organic devices. Design and Performance of Rechargeable Sodium Ion Batteries, and Symmetrical Li-Ion Batteries with Supercapacitor-Like Power Density Based upon Polyoxovanadates The polyanion Li7V15O36(CO3) is a nanosized molecular cluster (≈1 nm in size), that has the potential to form an open host framework with a higher surface-to-bulk ratio than conventional transition metal oxide electrode materials. Herein, practical rechargeable Na-ion batteries and symmetric Li-ion batteries are demonstrated based on the polyoxovanadate Li7V15O36(CO3). The vanadium centers in {V15O36(CO3)} do not all have the same VIV/V redox potentials, which permits symmetric devices to be created from this material that exhibit battery-like energy density and supercapacitor-like power density. An ultrahigh specific power of 51.5 kW kg−1 at 100 A g−1 and a specific energy of 125 W h kg−1 can be achieved, along with a long cycling life (>500 cycles). Moreover, electrochemical and theoretical studies reveal that {V15O36(CO3)} also allows the transport of large cations, like Na+, and that it can serve as the cathode material for rechargeable Na-ion batteries with a high specific capacity of 240 mA h g−1 and a specific energy of 390 W h kg−1 for the full Na-ion battery. Finally, the polyoxometalate material from these electrochemical energy storage devices can be easily extracted from spent electrodes by simple treatment with water, providing a potential route to recycling of the redox active material. Synthesis of Dibenzo[hi,st\\n]ovalene and Its Amplified Spontaneous Emission in a Polystyrene Matrix A large number of graphene molecules, or large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have been synthesized and display various optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, their potential for application in photonics has remained largely unexplored. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a highly luminescent and stable graphene molecule, namely a substituted dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBO 1), with zigzag edges and elucidate its promising optical-gain properties by means of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Upon incorporation of DBO into an inert polystyrene matrix, amplified stimulated emission can be observed with a relatively low power threshold (ca. 60\\u2005μJ\\u2009cm−2), thus highlighting its high potential for lasing applications. Human versus Robots in the Discovery and Crystallization of Gigantic Polyoxometalates Abstract The discovery of new gigantic molecules formed by self‐assembly and crystal growth is challenging as it combines two contingent events; first is the formation of a new molecule, and second its crystallization. Herein, we construct a workflow that can be followed manually or by a robot to probe the envelope of both events and employ it for a new polyoxometalate cluster, Na6[Mo120Ce6O366H12(H2O)78]⋅200\\u2009H2O (1) which has a trigonal‐ring type architecture (yield 4.3\\u2009% based on Mo). Its synthesis and crystallization was probed using an active machine‐learning algorithm developed by us to explore the crystallization space, the algorithm results were compared with those obtained by human experimenters. The algorithm‐based search is able to cover ca. 9 times more crystallization space than a random search and ca. 6 times more than humans and increases the crystallization prediction accuracy to 82.4±0.7\\u2009% over 77.1±0.9\\u2009% from human experimenters. Switching Diarylethenes Reliably in Both Directions with Visible Light A diarylethene photoswitch was covalently connected to two small triplet sensitizer moieties in a conjugated and nonconjugated fashion and the photochromic performance of the resulting compounds was investigated. In comparison with the parent diarylethene (without sensitizers) and one featuring saturated linkages, the conjugated photoswitch offers superior fatigue resistance upon visible-light excitation due to effective triplet energy transfer from the biacetyl termini to the diarylethene core. Our design makes it possible to switch diarylethenes with visible light in both directions in a highly efficient and robust fashion based on extending π-conjugation and by-product-free ring-closure via the triplet manifold. Peer Reviewed Self-Templating and In\\u2005Situ Assembly of a Cubic Cluster-of-Clusters Architecture Based on a {Mo24Fe12} Inorganic Macrocycle Abstract Engineering self‐templating inorganic architectures is critical for the development of bottom‐up approaches to nanoscience, but systems with a hierarchy of templates are elusive. Herein we describe that the cluster‐anion‐templated (CAT) assembly of a {CAT}⊂{Mo24Fe12} macrocycle forms a giant ca. 220\\u2005nm3 unit cell containing 16\\u2005macrocycles clustered into eight face‐shared tetrahedral cluster‐of‐clusters assemblies. We show that {CAT}⊂{Mo24Fe12} with different CATs gives the compounds 1–4 for CAT=Anderson {FeMo6} (1), Keggin {PMo12} (2), Dawson {P2W18} (3), and {Mo12O36(HPO3)2} (4) polyoxometalates. “Template‐free” assembly can be achieved, whereby the macrocycle components can also form a template in\\u2005situ allowing template to macrocycle to superstructure formation and the ability to exchange the templates. Furthermore, the transformation of template clusters within the inorganic macrocycle {Mo24Fe12} allows the self‐generation of an uncapped {Mo12O36(HPO3)2} in compound 4. Spontaneous Assembly of an Organic-Inorganic Nucleic Acid Z-DNA Double-Helix Structure Herein, we report a hybrid polyoxometalate organic–inorganic compound, Na2[(HGMP)2Mo5O15]⋅7\\u2009H2O (1; where GMP=guanosine monophosphate), which spontaneously assembles into a structure with dimensions that are strikingly similar to those of the naturally occurring left-handed Z-form of DNA. The helical parameters in the crystal structure of the new compound, such as rise per turn and helical twist per dimer, are nearly identical to this DNA conformation, allowing a close comparison of the two structures. Solution circular dichroism studies show that compound 1 also forms extended secondary structures in solution. Gel electrophoresis studies demonstrate the formation of non-covalent adducts with natural plasmids. Thus we show a route by which simple hybrid inorganic–organic monomers, such as compound 1, can spontaneously assemble into a double helix without the need for a covalently connected linear sequence of nucleic acid base pairs. Light-Activated Sensitive Probes for Amine Detection Our new, simple, and accurate colorimetric method is based on diarylethenes (DAEs) for the rapid detection of a wide range of primary and secondary amines. The probes consist of aldehyde- or ketone-substituted diarylethenes, which undergo an amine-induced decoloration reaction, selectively to give the ring-closed isomer. Thus, these probes can be activated at the desired moment by light irradiation, with a sensitivity that allows the detection of amines at concentrations as low as 10exp−6\\u2009M in solution. In addition, the practical immobilization of DAEs on paper makes it possible to detect biogenic amines, such as cadaverine, in the gas phase above a threshold of 12\\u2005ppbv within 30\\u2005seconds. Peer Reviewed Miller-Urey Spark-Discharge Experiments in the Deuterium World Abstract We designed and conducted a series of primordial‐soup Miller‐Urey style experiments with deuterated gases and reagents to compare the spark‐discharge products of a “deuterated world” with the standard reaction in the “hydrogenated world”. While the deuteration of the system has little effect on the distribution of amino acid products, significant differences are seen in other regions of the product‐space. Not only do we observe about 120\\u2005new species, we also see significant differences in their distribution if the two hydrogen isotope worlds are compared. Several isotopologue matches can be identified in both, but a large proportion of products have no equivalent in the corresponding isotope world with ca. 43\\u2005new species in the D world and ca. 39\\u2005new species in the H world. This shows that isotopic exchange (the addition of only one neutron) may lead to significant additional complexity in chemical space under otherwise identical reaction conditions.

Exploring the Molecular Growth of Two Gigantic Half‐Closed Polyoxometalate Clusters {Mo\\n            180\\n            } and {Mo\\n            130\\n            Ce\\n            6\\n            } Abstract Understanding the process of the self‐assembly of gigantic polyoxometalates and their subsequent molecular growth, by the addition of capping moieties onto the oxo‐frameworks, is critical for the development of the designed assembly of complex high‐nuclearity cluster species, yet such processes remain far from being understood. Herein we describe the molecular growth from {Mo150} and {Mo120Ce6} to afford two half‐closed gigantic molybdenum blue clusters {Mo180} (1) and {Mo130Ce6} (2), respectively. Compound 1 features a hat‐shaped structure with the parent wheel‐shaped {Mo150} being capped by a {Mo30} unit on one side. Similarly, 2 exhibits an elliptical lanthanide‐doped wheel {Mo120Ce6} that is sealed by a {Mo10} unit on one side. Moreover, the observation of the parent uncapped {Mo150} and {Mo120Ce6} clusters as minor products during the synthesis of 1 and 2 strongly suggests that the molecular growth process can be initialized from {Mo150} and {Mo120Ce6} in solution, respectively.

Evidence for Triplet Sensitization in the Visible‐Light‐Induced [2+2]\\u2005Photocycloaddition of Eniminium Ions Abstract Εniminium ions were prepared from the corresponding α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds (enones and enals), and were found to be promoted to their respective triplet states by energy transfer. The photoexcited intermediates underwent intra‐ or intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition in good yields (50–78\\u2009%) upon irradiation at λ=433\\u2005nm or λ=457\\u2005nm. Iridium or ruthenium complexes with a sufficiently high triplet energy were identified as efficient catalysts (2.5\\u2005mol\\u2009% catalyst loading) for the reaction. The intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of an eniminium ion derived from a chiral secondary amine proceeded with high enantioselectivity (88\\u2009% ee). Chromophore Activation of α,β-Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds and Its Application to Enantioselective Photochemical Reactions Abstract The first law of photochemistry, as described by Theodor von\\u2005Grotthuß and John\\u2005W. Draper, states that only the light absorbed by the irradiated matter can effect photochemical change. Consequently, the photochemical behavior of a molecule can be controlled by bringing its absorbance properties in line with the emission of the light source. A compound with a chromophore that only absorbs light at short wavelengths will not be excited by light of longer wavelengths. If one can reversibly modify the photophysical properties of a compound with a chemical activator, then it is possible to photoexcite only the activated species. For α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds, the use of Lewis acids, Brønsted acids, or the formation of the respective iminium ions can bring about the desired chromophore activation to catalyze a photochemical reaction at a given wavelength. In this Minireview, the concept of chromophore activation will be illustrated, and examples of its implementation in enantioselective catalysis will be discussed. Synthesis of Triply Fused Porphyrin-Nanographene Conjugates Two unprecedented porphyrin fused nanographene molecules, 1 and 2, have been synthesized by the Scholl reaction from tailor-made precursors based on benzo[m]tetraphene-substituted porphyrins. The chemical structures were validated by a combination of high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HR MALDI-TOF MS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The UV-vis-near infrared absorption spectroscopy of 1 and 2 demonstrated broad and largely red-shifted absorption spectra extending up to 1000 and 1400\\u2005nm, respectively, marking the significant extension of the π-conjugated systems. ispartof: ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION vol:57 issue:35 pages:11233-11237 ispartof: location:Germany status: published Development of a Minimal Photosystem for Hydrogen Production in Inorganic Chemical Cells Abstract Inorganic chemical cells (iCHELLs) are compartment structures consisting of polyoxometalates (POMs) and cations, offering structured and confined reaction spaces bounded by membranes. We have constructed a system capable of efficient anisotropic and hierarchical photo‐induced electron transfer across the iCHELL membrane. Mimicking photosynthesis, our system uses proton gradients between the compartment and the bulk to drive efficient conversion of light into chemical energy, producing hydrogen upon irradiation. This illustrates the power of the iCHELL approach for catalysis, where the structure, compartmentalisation and variation in possible components could be utilised to approach a wide range of reactions. Artificial Gel-Based Organelles for Spatial Organization of Cell-Free Gene Expression Reactions In biological cells, chemical processes often occur inside specialized subcellular compartments or organelles. For instance, in eukaryotes mRNA is transcribed and processed inside the nucleus, exported to the endoplasmic reticulum, and translated into the encoded protein. Inspired by this high degree of intracellular organization, we here develop gel-based artificial organelles that enable sequence-specific and programmable localization of cell-free transcription and translation reactions inside an artificial cellular system. To this end, we utilize agarose microgels covalently modified with DNA templates coding for various functions and encapsulate them into emulsion droplets. We show that RNA signals transcribed from transcription organelles can be specifically targeted to capture organelles via hybridization to the corresponding DNA addresses. We also demonstrate that mRNA molecules, produced from transcription organelles and controlled by toehold switch riboregulators, are only translated in translation organelles containing their cognate DNA triggers. Spatial confinement of transcription and translation in separate organelles is thus superficially similar to gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Combining communicating gel spheres with specialized functions opens up new possibilities for programming artificial cellular systems at the organelle level. Ligand‐Directed Template Assembly for the Construction of Gigantic Molybdenum Blue Wheels Abstract Template‐mediated synthesis is a powerful approach to build a variety of functional materials and complex supramolecular systems. However, the systematic study of how templates structurally evolve from basic building blocks, and then affect the templated self‐assembly, is critical to understanding and utilizing the underlying mechanism, to work towards designed assembly. Here we describe the templated self‐assembly of a series of gigantic Mo Blue (MB) clusters 1–4 using l‐ornithine as a structure‐directing ligand. We show that by using l‐ornithine as a structure director, we can form new template⊂host assemblies. Based on the structural relationship between encapsulated templates of {Mo8} (1), {Mo17} (2) and {Mo36} (4), a pathway of the structural evolution of templates is proposed. This provides insight into how gigantic Mo Blue cluster rings form and could lead to full control over the designed assembly of gigantic Mo‐blue rings. Triplet Energy Transfer from Ruthenium Complexes to Chiral Eniminium Ions: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutane\\xadcarbaldehydes by [2+2] Photocycloaddition Abstract Chiral eniminium salts, prepared from α,β‐unsaturated aldehydes and a chiral proline derived secondary amine, underwent, upon irradiation with visible light, a ruthenium‐catalyzed (2.5\\u2005mol\\u2009%) intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition to olefins, which after hydrolysis led to chiral cyclobutanecarbaldehydes (17 examples, 49–74\\u2009% yield), with high diastereo‐ and enantioselectivities. Ru(bpz)3(PF6)2 was utilized as the ruthenium catalyst and laser flash photolysis studies show that the catalyst operates exclusively by triplet‐energy transfer (sensitization). A catalytic system was devised with a chiral secondary amine co‐catalyst. In the catalytic reactions, Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 was employed, and laser flash photolysis experiments suggest it undergoes both electron and energy transfer. However, experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that energy transfer is the only productive quenching mechanism. Control experiments using Ir(ppy)3 showed no catalysis for the intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of an eniminium ion. Competitive Salt Precipitation/Dissolution During Free‐Water Reduction in Water‐in‐Salt Electrolyte Abstract Water‐in‐salt electrolytes based on highly concentrated bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonimide (TFSI) promise aqueous electrolytes with stabilities nearing 3\\u2005V. However, especially with an electrode approaching the cathodic (reductive) stability, cycling stability is insufficient. While stability critically relies on a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), the mechanism behind the cathodic stability limit remains unclear. Now, two distinct reduction potentials are revealed for the chemical environments of free and bound water and that both contribute to SEI formation. Free water is reduced about 1\\u2005V above bound water in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and is responsible for SEI formation via reactive intermediates of the HER; concurrent LiTFSI precipitation/dissolution establishes a dynamic interface. The free‐water population emerges, therefore, as the handle to extend the cathodic limit of aqueous electrolytes and the battery cycling stability. Covalent Modification of Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite with a Stable Organic Free Radical by Using Diazonium Chemistry A novel, persistent, electrochemically active perchlorinated triphenylmethyl (PTM) radical with a diazonium functionality has been covalently attached to highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by electrografting in a single-step process. Electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) and Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed that PTM molecules had a higher tendency to covalently react at the HOPG step edges. The cross-section profiles from EC-STM images showed that there was current enhancement at the functionalized areas, which could be explained by redox-mediated electron tunneling through surface-confined redox-active molecules. Cyclic voltammetry clearly demonstrated that the intrinsic properties of the organic radical were preserved upon grafting and DFT calculations also revealed that the magnetic character of the PTM radical was preserved. Light-Controlled Reversible Modulation of Frontier Molecular Orbital Energy Levels in Trifluoromethylated Diarylethenes Among bistable photochromic molecules, diarylethenes (DAEs) possess the distinct feature that upon photoisomerization they undergo a large modulation of their π-electronic system, accompanied by a marked shift of the HOMO/LUMO energies and hence oxidation/reduction potentials. The electronic modulation can be utilized to remote-control charge- as well as energy-transfer processes and it can be transduced to functional entities adjacent to the DAE core, thereby regulating their properties. In order to exploit such photoswitchable systems it is important to precisely adjust the absolute position of their HOMO and LUMO levels and to maximize the extent of the photoinduced shifts of these energy levels. Here, we present a comprehensive study detailing how variation of the substitution pattern of DAE compounds, in particular using strongly electron-accepting and chemically stable trifluoromethyl groups either in the periphery or at the reactive carbon atoms, allows for the precise tuning of frontier molecular orbital levels over a broad energy range and the generation of photoinduced shifts of more than 1\\u2005eV. Furthermore, the effect of different DAE architectures on the transduction of these shifts to an adjacent functional group is discussed. Whereas substitution in the periphery of the DAE motif has only minor implications on the photochemistry, trifluoromethylation at the reactive carbon atoms strongly disturbs the isomerization efficiency. However, this can be overcome by using a nonsymmetrical substitution pattern or by combination with donor groups, rendering the resulting photoswitches attractive candidates for the construction of remote-controlled functional systems. Peer Reviewed Tetrathiafulvalene-Polychlorotriphenylmethyl Dyads: Influence of Bridge and Open-Shell Characteristics on Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties Three conjugated donor-π-acceptor radical systems (1\\u2009a–1\\u2009c) were prepared by bridging a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) electron-donor unit to a polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) electron-acceptor radical through vinylene units of different lengths. The dependence of the intramolecular charge transfer on the length of the conjugated bridge has been analyzed by different electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Linear optical properties and the second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) response of these derivatives have been computed by comparing systems 1\\u2009a–1\\u2009c with the non-radical analogues (2\\u2009a–2\\u2009c). Interestingly, an enhanced NLO response is predicted for dyads 1\\u2009a–1\\u2009c with PTM in the radical form and for compounds with longer vinylene bridges. Calculations confirm the active role the bridge plays for electronic communication between the donor TTF and the acceptor PTM units. Carbon-Rich Monolayers on ITO as Highly Sensitive Platforms for Detecting Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Water: The Case of Pyrene The determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water at low levels is a current challenge given their great impact on the health and safety of the public. Here, a novel pyrene-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) platform is exploited as PAH sensing recognition device. Interestingly, the formation of π-π sandwich complexes between PAHs and the recognition element switches the surface electron transfer capability. The unique supramolecular interaction between identical aromatic molecules provides a highly sensitive and selective sensor for pyrene in the order of part per trillion. Accordingly, and using pyrene as a proof-of-concept, this work presents the basis for an \\'at-point-of-use\\' impedimetric sensor focused on a highly sensitive carbon-based SAM for PAHs determination in water at ultra-trace levels. Role of the Open-Shell Character on the Pressure-Induced Conductivity of an Organic Donor-Acceptor Radical Dyad Single‐component conductors based on neutral organic radicals have received a lot of attention due to the possibility that the unpaired electron can serve as a charge carrier without the need of a previous doping process. Although most of these systems are based on delocalized planar radicals, we present here a nonplanar and spin localized radical based on a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) moiety, linked to a perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical by a conjugated bridge, which exhibits a semiconducting behavior upon application of high pressure. The synthesis, electronic properties, and crystal structure of this neutral radical TTF‐Ph‐PTM derivative (1) are reported and implications of its crystalline structure on its electrical properties are discussed. On the other hand, the non‐radical derivative (2), which is isostructural with the radical 1, shows an insulating behavior at all measured pressures. The different electronic structures of these two isostructural systems have a direct influence on the conducting properties, as demonstrated by band structure DFT calculations. Establishing Communication Between Artificial Cells Communication between artificial cells is essential for the realization of complex dynamical behaviors at the multi-cell level. It is also an important prerequisite for modular systems design, because it determines how spatially separated functional modules can coordinate their actions. Among others, molecular communication is required for artificial cell signaling, synchronization of cellular behaviors, computation, group-level decision-making processes and pattern formation in artificial tissues. In this review, an overview of various recent approaches to create communicating artificial cellular systems is provided. In this context, important physicochemical boundary conditions that have to be considered for the design of the communicating cells are also described, and a survey of the most striking emergent behaviors that may be achieved in such systems is given. A transmurally heterogeneous orthotropic activation model for ventricular contraction and its numerical validation Models for cardiac mechanics require an activation mechanism properly representing the stress-strain relations in the contracting myocardium. In this paper, we propose a new activation model that accounts for the transmural heterogeneities observed in myocardial strain measurements. In order to take the anisotropy of the active mechanics into account, our model is based on an active strain formulation. Thanks to multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor, in this formulation, the active strains orthogonal to the fibers can be naturally described. We compare the results of our novel formulation against different anisotropic models of the active contraction of the cardiac muscle, as well as against experimental data available in the literature. We show that with the currently available models, the strain distributions are not in agreement with the reported experimental measurements. Conversely, we show that our new transmurally heterogeneous orthotropic activation model improves the accuracy of shear strains related to in-plane rotations and torsion. Fully coupled fluid-electro-mechanical model of the human heart for supercomputers In this work, we present a fully coupled fluid-electro-mechanical model of a 50th percentile human heart. The model is implemented on Alya, the BSC multi-physics parallel code, capable of running efficiently in supercomputers. Blood in the cardiac cavities is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme. Electrophysiology is modeled with a monodomain scheme and the O\\'Hara-Rudy cell model. Solid mechanics is modeled with a total Lagrangian formulation for discrete strains using the Holzapfel-Ogden cardiac tissue material model. The three problems are simultaneously and bidirectionally coupled through an electromechanical feedback and a fluid-structure interaction scheme. In this paper, we present the scheme in detail and propose it as a computational cardiac workbench. Computational fluid dynamics of blood flow in an idealized left human heart We construct an idealized computational model of the left human heart for the study of the blood flow dynamics in the left atrium and ventricle. We solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the ALE formulation and we prescribe the left heart wall displacement based on physiological data; moreover, we consider the presence of both the mitral and aortic valves through the resistive method. We simulate the left heart hemodynamics by means of the finite element method and we consider the variational multiscale large eddy simulation (LES) formulation to account for the transitional and nearly turbulent regimes of the blood flow in physiological conditions. The main contribution of this paper is the characterization of the blood flow in an idealized configuration of the left heart aiming at reproducing function in normal conditions. Our assessment is based on the analysis of instantaneous and phase averaged velocity fields, blood pressure, and other clinically meaningful fluid dynamics indicators. Finally, we show that our idealized computational model can be suitably used to study and critically discuss pathological scenarios like that of a regurgitant mitral valve. Electronic Properties of Optically Switchable Photochromic Diarylethene Molecules at the Interface with Organic Semiconductors Light-switching induced changes in the electronic properties of photochromic diarylethene, i.e., 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-p-tolylthiophen-3-yl)cyclopent-1-ene (DAE1), thin films at interfaces to a gold electrode and two polymer semiconductors were investigated by direct and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. The photoisomerization was achieved by in situ irradiation of ultraviolet and visible light. Efficient and reversible switching between the open and closed isomers of DAE1 was evidenced at all interfaces, with profound impact on the energy level alignment. The frontier occupied level of DAE1 changes by 0.8 eV with respect to the Au Fermi level upon switching. Corresponding sizable changes in the electron and transport level offsets between the two polymers and DAE1 in its open and closed form were determined. This gives rise to fundamentally different functionality of these interfaces in terms of charge transport. Our study proves the viability of light controlled energy level manipulation at various interfaces in photoswitchable opto-electronic devices. Design of Perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) Radical-Based Compounds for Optoelectronic Applications: The Role of Orbital Delocalization Perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical‐based compounds are widely exploited as molecular switching units. However, their application in optoelectronics is limited by the fact that they exhibit intense absorption bands only in a narrow range of the UV region around 385\\u2005nm. Recent experimental works have reported new PTM based compounds which present a broad absorption in the visible region although the origin of this behavior is not fully explained. In this context, Time‐Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD‐DFT) calculations have been performed to rationalize the optical properties of these compounds. Moreover, a new compound based on PTM disubstituted with bistriazene units has been synthetized and characterized to complete the set of available experimental data on related compounds. The results point to the delocalization of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the substituents along the PTM core as the origin of the new high absorption bands in the visible region. As a consequence, the absorption of the PTM‐based compounds can be tuned via the choice of the nature of the donor substituent, type of connection, and number of substituents. Influence of CYP2C19\\n Phenotype on the Effect of Clopidogrel in Patients Undergoing a Percutaneous Neurointervention Procedure This observational retrospective study assessed the antiplatelet response and clinical events after clopidogrel treatment in patients who underwent percutaneous neurointervention, related to CYP2C19 metabolizer status (normal (NM), intermediate/poor (IM‐PM), and ultrarapid (UM); inferred from *2, *3, and *17 allele determination). From 123 patients, IM‐PM had a higher aggregation value (201.1 vs. 137.6\\u2009NM, 149.4 UM, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and lower response rate (37.5% vs. 69.8% NM, 61.1% UM), along with higher treatment change rate (25% vs. 5.7% NM, 10.5% UM). The highest ischemic events incidence occurred in NM (11.3% vs. 6.3% IM, 10.5% UM) and hemorrhagic events in UM (13.2% vs. 0% IM and 3.8% NM). No differences were found regarding ischemic event onset time, while hemorrhagic event frequency in UM was higher with shorter onset time (P\\u2009=\\u20090.047). CYP2C19 no‐function and increased function alleles defined the clopidogrel response. UM patients had increased bleeding risk. Therapeutic recommendations should include dose reduction or treatment change in UM. Functional Impairment of Circulating FcεRI+\\n Monocytes and Myeloid Dendritic Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma Patients Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represent the most common primary liver malignancies whose outcome is influenced by the immune response. Methods In this study, we have functionally characterized, by flow cytometry, circulating myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and FceRI+ monocytes in a group of healthy individuals (n = 10) and in a group of patients with HCC (n = 19) and CCA (n = 8), at the time point of the surgical resection (T0) and once the patient had recovered from surgery (T1). Moreover, we proceeded to a more in depth phenotypic characterization of the FceRI+ monocyte subpopulation. Results A significant decrease in the frequency of TNFα producing FceRI+ monocytes and mDCs in HCC and CCA patients when compared to the group of healthy individuals was observed, and a close association between FceRI+ monocytes and mDCs dysfunction was identified. In addition, the phenotypic characteristics of FceRI+ monocytes from healthy individuals strongly suggest that this population drives to mDCs, which matches with the fact that both populations are functionally affected. Conclusions The frequency and the function of circulating mDCs and FceRI+ monocytes are affected in both HCC and CCA patients, and FceRI+ monocytes could represent those fated to become mDCs. © 2019 International Clinical Cytometry Society. Thermal tolerance of Mediterranean marine macrophytes: Vulnerability to global warming The Mediterranean Sea is warming at three times the rate of the global ocean raising concerns about the vulnerability of marine organisms to climate change. Macrophytes play a key role in coastal ecosystems, therefore predicting how warming will affect these key species is critical to understand the effects of climate change on Mediterranean coastal ecosystems. We measured the physiological performance of six dominant native Mediterranean macrophytes under ten temperature treatments ranging from 12 to 34°C to examine their thermal niche, and vulnerability to projected warming in the western Mediterranean up until 2100. Among the macrophytes tested, Cymodocea nodosa was the species with the highest thermal optima and it was beyond current summer temperature. Therefore, C. nodosa may benefit from projected warming over the coming century. The optimal temperature for growth of the other species (Posidonia oceanica, Cystoseira compressa, Padina pavonica, Caulerpa prolifera, and Halimeda tuna) was lower. Similarly, the species presented different upper lethal limits, spanning at least across 5.1°C between 28.9°C (P. oceanica) and >34°C (C. nodosa). Our results demonstrate the variable physiological responses of species within the same local community to temperature changes and highlight important potential differences in climate change vulnerability, among species within coastal marine ecosystems. Characterization of Nitrophospholipid-Peptide Covalent Adducts by Electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry: A First Screening Analysis Using Different Instrumental Platforms Lipids are well‐known targets of reactive nitrogen species and this reaction leads to the formation of nitrated lipids that have been associated with anti‐inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. Nitro‐fatty acids (NO2‐FA) are highly electrophilic compounds that can form covalent adducts with proteins, leading to the formation of lipoxidation adducts, which modulate the protein structure and function. Nitrated phospholipids (NO2‐PL) have been detected recently in biological samples, but their biological effects are unknown, although similarly to what has been described for nitrated lipids, it has been hypothesized that they may react with peptides and proteins. In this study, in vitro biomimetic assays are used to synthetize adducts of nitrated POPC (NO2POPC), already detected in biological samples, and GSH peptide. The formation of NO2POPC‐GSH adducts is studied by ESI‐MS and MS2, using both low and high energy CID in different MS platforms: a LXQ linear ion trap, a Q‐TOF 2, and a Q‐Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole‐Orbitrap. Typical product ions observed under MS2 conditions are modified b, y, and C ions bearing NO2POPC covalently linked that unequivocally confirms the presence of the lipid‐peptide adduct. Typical loss of HNO2 is only observed in the MS2 of the mono‐charged precursor ions, [M+H]+. Product ions at m/z 184 or neutral loss of 183\\u2009Da are assigned as typical fragmentations that confirm the presence of the phosphatidylcholine. In summary, the characterization of nitro PL‐peptide adducts by MS and MS2 allows the identification of the structure and specific MS2 reporter ions to be used to pinpoint these adductions in biological systems. published Systemic regulation of bilirubin homeostasis: Potential benefits of hyperbilirubinemia Neurotoxic bilirubin is the end product of heme catabolism in mammals. Bilirubin is solely conjugated by uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid. Due to low function of hepatic and intestinal uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 during the neonatal period, human neonates develop mild to severe physiological hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulation of bilirubin in the brain leads to the onset of irreversible brain damage, termed kernicterus. Breastfeeding is one of the most significant factors that increase the risk of developing kernicterus in infants. Why does this most natural way of feeding increase the risk of brain damage or even death? This question leads to the hypothesis that breast milk-induced hyperbilirubinemia might bring certain benefits that outweigh those risks. While bilirubin is neurotoxic and cytotoxic, this compound is also a potent antioxidant. There are studies showing improved clinical conditions in patients with hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulating evidence also shows that genetic polymorphisms linked to hyperbilirubinemia are beneficial against various diseases. In this review article, we first introduce the production, metabolism, and transport of bilirubin. We then discuss the potential benefits of neonatal and adult hyperbilirubinemia. Finally, epigenetic factors as well as metabolomic information associated with hyperbilirubinemia are described. This review article advances the understanding of the physiological importance of the paradoxical compound bilirubin. (Hepatology 2018;67:1609-1619). Preemptive‐TIPS Improves Outcome in High‐Risk Variceal Bleeding: An Observational Study Patients admitted with acute variceal bleeding (AVB) and Child-Pugh C score (CP-C) or Child-Pugh B plus active bleeding at endoscopy (CP-B+AB) are at high risk for treatment failure, rebleeding, and mortality. A preemptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (p-TIPS) has been shown to improve survival in these patients, but its use in clinical practice has been challenged and not routinely incorporated. The present study aimed to further validate the role of preemptive TIPS in a large number of high-risk patients. This multicenter, international, observational study included 671 patients from 34 centers admitted for AVB and high risk of treatment failure. Patients were managed according to current guidelines, and use of drugs and endoscopic therapy (D+E) or p-TIPS was based on individual center policy. p-TIPS in the setting of AVB is associated with a lower mortality in CP-C patients compared with D+E (1 year mortality 22% vs. 47% in D+E group; P\\xa0=\\xa00.002). Mortality rate in CP-B+AB patients was low, and p-TIPS did not improve it. In CP-C and CP-B+AB patients, p-TIPS reduced treatment failure and rebleeding (1-year cumulative incidence function probability of remaining free of the composite endpoint: 92% vs. 74% in the D+E group; P\\xa0=\\xa00.017) and development of de novo or worsening of previous ascites without increasing rates of hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion: p-TIPS must be the treatment of choice in CP-C patients with AVB. Because of the strong benefit in preventing further bleeding and ascites, p-TIPS could be a good treatment strategy for CP-B+AB patients. ispartof: HEPATOLOGY vol:69 issue:1 pages:282-293 ispartof: location:United States status: published Relationship Among Fatty Liver, Specific and Multiple‐Site Atherosclerosis, and 10‐Year Framingham Score International audience; Despite a well-documented increase in the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with steatosis, the relationship among steatosis and atherosclerosis, specific atherosclerotic sites, multiple-site atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular risk prediction is incompletely understood. We studied the relationship among steatosis, atherosclerosis site, multiple-site atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and 10-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in 2,554 patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), free of cardiovascular events and other chronic liver diseases, and drinking less than 50 g alcohol/day. All patients underwent arterial ultrasound (carotid [CP] and femoral [FP] plaques defined as intima-media thickness (IMT) > 1.5 mm), coronary computed tomography scan (severe CAC if ≥ 100), 10-year FRS calculation, and steatosis detection by the fatty liver index (FLI, present if score ≥ 60). Patients with steatosis (36% of total) had higher prevalence of CP (50% versus 45%, P = 0.004) and higher CAC (181 ± 423 versus 114 ± 284, P < 0.001) but similar prevalence of FP (53% versus 50%, P = 0.099) than patients without steatosis. Steatosis was associated with carotid IMT and CAC, but not with FP, independent of age, diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use (P < 0.001). Fifty-three percent of patients had at least 2-site atherosclerosis and steatosis was associated with at least 2-site atherosclerosis independent of age and CVRF (odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.45, P = 0.035). Sixty-four percent of patients with steatosis had a FRS score of 10% or more. FLI was associated with FRS beyond the CVRF or the number of atherosclerosis sites (P < 0.001). Adding FLI to CVRF predicted an FRS greater than or equal to 10% better than CVRF alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.848 versus 0.768, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Steatosis is associated with carotid and coronary, but not femoral atherosclerosis, and with cardiovascular mortality risk. The multiple-site involvement and quantitative tonic relationship could reinforce the prediction of cardiovascular mortality or events over classical CVRF or imaging-based detection of atherosclerosis. qFIBS: A Novel Automated Technique for Quantitative Evaluation of Fibrosis, Inflammation, Ballooning, and Steatosis in Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis [Approach and Results] Images were acquired by SHG/TPEF from 219 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH liver biopsy samples from seven centers in Asia and Europe. These were used to develop and validate qFIBS, a computational algorithm that quantifies key histological features of NASH. qFIBS was developed based on in silico analysis of selected signature parameters for four cardinal histopathological features, that is, fibrosis (qFibrosis), inflammation (qInflammation), hepatocyte ballooning (qBallooning), and steatosis (qSteatosis), treating each as a continuous rather than categorical variable. Automated qFIBS analysis outputs showed strong correlation with each respective component of the NASH CRN scoring (P < 0.001; qFibrosis [r = 0.776], qInflammation [r = 0.557], qBallooning [r = 0.533], and qSteatosis [r = 0.802]) and high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (qFibrosis [0.870‐0.951; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.787‐1.000; P < 0.001], qInflammation [0.820‐0.838; 95% CI, 0.726‐0.933; P < 0.001), qBallooning [0.813‐0.844; 95% CI, 0.708‐0.957; P < 0.001], and qSteatosis [0.939‐0.986; 95% CI, 0.867‐1.000; P < 0.001]) and was able to distinguish differing grades/stages of histological disease. Performance of qFIBS was best when assessing degree of steatosis and fibrosis, but performed less well when distinguishing severe inflammation and higher ballooning grades. Acute decompensation boosts hepatic collagen type III deposition and deteriorates experimental and human cirrhosis Patients with end-stage liver disease develop acute decompensation (AD) episodes, which become more frequent and might develop into acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). However, it remains unknown how AD induces acceleration of liver disease. We hypothesized that remodeling of collagen type III plays a role in the acceleration of liver cirrhosis after AD and analyzed its formation (Pro-C3) and degradation (matrix metalloproteinase-degraded type III collagen [C3M]) markers in animal models and human disease. Bile duct ligation induced different stages of liver fibrosis in rats. Fibrosis development (hydroxyprolin content, sirius red staining, α-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry, messenger RNA of profibrotic cytokines), necroinflammation (aminotransferases levels), fibrolysis (matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression and activity, C1M, C4M), and Pro-C3 and C3M were analyzed 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after bile duct ligation (n = 5 each group). In 110 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure for AD, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as Pro-C3 and C3M were measured in blood samples from portal and hepatic veins and were collected just before the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and 1-3 weeks later. Animal studies showed increased markers of collagen type III deposition with fibrosis, necroinflammation, and decompensation of liver cirrhosis, defined as ascites development. Higher Pro-C3 levels were associated with injury, disease severity scores (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, Child-Pugh, chronic liver failure-C AD), ACLF development, and mortality. C3M decreased with AD and the chronic liver failure-C AD score. Collagen type III deposition ratio increased with the risk of ACLF development and mortality. Conclusion: We show for the first time that AD boosts collagen type III deposition in experimental and human cirrhosis, possibly contributing to the worsened outcome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. (Hepatology Communications 2018;2:211-222). Germline variant burden in multidrug resistance transporters is a therapy‐specific predictor of survival in breast cancer patients Multidrug resistance due to facilitated drug efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is a main cause for failure of cancer therapy. Genetic polymorphisms in ABC genes affect the disposition of chemotherapeutics and constitute important biomarkers for therapeutic response and toxicity. Here we correlated germline variability in ABC transporters with disease-specific survival (DSS) in 960 breast cancer (BRCA), 314 clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 325 hepatocellular carcinoma patients. We find that variant burden in ABCC1 is a strong predictor of DSS in BRCA patients, whereas candidate polymorphisms are not associated with DSS. This association is highly drug-specific for subgroups treated with the MRP1 substrates cyclophosphamide (log-rank p = 0.0011) and doxorubicin (log-rank p = 0.0088) independent of age and tumor stage, whereas no association was found in individuals treated with tamoxifen (log-rank p = 0.13). Structural mapping of significant variants revealed multiple variants at residues involved in protein stability, cofactor stabilization or substrate binding. Our results demonstrate that BRCA patients with high variant burden in ABCC1 are less prone to respond appropriately to pharmacological therapy with MRP1 substrates, thus incentivizing the consideration of genomic germline data for precision cancer medicine. Rapid and accurate assessment of GPCR-ligand interactions Using the fragment molecular orbital-based density-functional tight-binding method The reliable and precise evaluation of receptor–ligand interactions and pair‐interaction energy is an essential element of rational drug design. While quantum mechanical (QM) methods have been a promising means by which to achieve this, traditional QM is not applicable for large biological systems due to its high computational cost. Here, the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method has been used to accelerate QM calculations, and by combining FMO with the density‐functional tight‐binding (DFTB) method we are able to decrease computational cost 1000 times, achieving results in seconds, instead of hours. We have applied FMO‐DFTB to three different GPCR–ligand systems. Our results correlate well with site directed mutagenesis data and findings presented in the published literature, demonstrating that FMO‐DFTB is a rapid and accurate means of GPCR–ligand interactions. © 2017 Authors.

Typical epidemiology of respiratory virus infections in a Brazilian slum Abstract Host population size, density, immune status, age structure, and contact rates are critical elements of virus epidemiology. Slum populations stand out from other settings and may present differences in the epidemiology of acute viral infections. We collected nasopharyngeal specimens from 282 children aged ≤5 years with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) during 2005 to 2006 in one of the largest Brazilian slums. We conducted real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for 16 respiratory viruses, nested RT‐PCR‐based typing of rhinoviruses (HRVs), and collected clinical symptoms. Viruses were common causes of respiratory disease; with ≥1 virus being detected in 65.2% of patients. We detected 15 different viruses during 1 year with a predomidnance of HRV (33.0%) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV, 12.1%) infections, and a high rate of viral coinfections (28.3%). We observed seasonality of hRSV, HRV and human coronavirus infections, more severe symptoms in hRSV and influenza virus (FLU) infections and prolonged circulation of seven HRV clusters likely representing distinct serotypes according to genomic sequence distances. Potentially unusual findings included the absence of human metapneumovirus detections and lack of typical FLU seasonal patterns, which may be linked to the population size and density of the slum. Nonetheless, most epidemiological patterns were similar to other studies globally, suggesting surprising similarities of virus‐associated ARI across highly diverse settings and a complex impact of population characteristics on respiratory virus epidemiology. Injection Molding Micro- and Nanostructures in Thermoplastic Elastomers Flexible polymers such as poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) can be patterned at the micro- and nanoscale by casting, for a variety of applications. This replication-based fabrication process is relatively cheap and fast, yet injection molding offers an even faster and cheaper alternative to PDMS casting, provided thermoplastic polymers with similar mechanical properties can be used. In this paper, a thermoplastic polyurethane is evaluated for its patterning ability with an aim to forming the type of flexible structures used to measure and modulate the contractile forces of cells in tissue engineering experiments. The successful replication of grating structures is demonstrated with feature sizes as low as 100 nm and an analysis of certain processing conditions that facilitate and enhance the accuracy of this replication is presented. The results are benchmarked against an optical storage media grade polycarbonate. Obesity causes PGC‐1α deficiency in the pancreas leading to marked IL‐6 upregulation via NF‐κB in acute pancreatitis Obesity is associated with local and systemic complications in acute pancreatitis. PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator and master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that exhibits dysregulation in obese subjects. Our aims were: (1) to study PGC-1α levels in pancreas from lean or obese rats and mice with acute pancreatitis; and (2) to determine the role of PGC-1α in the inflammatory response during acute pancreatitis elucidating the signaling pathways regulated by PGC-1α. Lean and obese Zucker rats and lean and obese C57BL6 mice were used first; subsequently, wild-type and PGC-1α knockout (KO) mice with cerulein-induced pancreatitis were used to assess the inflammatory response and expression of target genes. Ppargc1a mRNA and protein levels were markedly downregulated in pancreas of obese rats and mice versus lean animals. PGC-1α protein levels increased in pancreas of lean mice with acute pancreatitis, but not in obese mice with pancreatitis. Interleukin-6 (Il6) mRNA levels were dramatically upregulated in pancreas of PGC-1α KO mice after cerulein-induced pancreatitis in comparison with wild-type mice with pancreatitis. Edema and the inflammatory infiltrate were more intense in pancreas from PGC-1α KO mice than in wild-type mice. The lack of PGC-1α markedly enhanced nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 and recruitment of p65 to Il6 promoter. PGC-1α bound phospho-p65 in pancreas during pancreatitis in wild-type mice. Glutathione depletion in cerulein-induced pancreatitis was more severe in KO mice than in wild-type mice. PGC-1α KO mice with pancreatitis, but not wild-type mice, exhibited increased myeloperoxidase activity in the lungs, together with alveolar wall thickening and collapse, which were abrogated by blockade of the IL-6 receptor glycoprotein 130 with LMT-28. In conclusion, obese rodents exhibit PGC-1α deficiency in the pancreas. PGC-1α acts as selective repressor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) towards IL-6 in pancreas. PGC-1α deficiency markedly enhanced NF-κB-mediated upregulation of Il6 in pancreas in pancreatitis, leading to a severe inflammatory response. PGC‐1α deficiency causes spontaneous kidney inflammation and increases the severity of nephrotoxic AKI PGC‐1α (peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator‐1α, PPARGC1A) regulates the expression of genes involved in energy homeostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we identify inactivation of the transcriptional regulator PGC‐1α as a landmark for experimental nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) and describe the in vivo consequences of PGC‐1α deficiency over inflammation and cell death in kidney injury. Kidney transcriptomic analyses of WT mice with folic acid‐induced AKI revealed 1398 up‐ and 1627 downregulated genes. Upstream transcriptional regulator analyses pointed to PGC‐1α as the transcription factor potentially driving the observed expression changes with the highest reduction in activity. Reduced PGC‐1α expression was shared by human kidney injury. Ppargc1a−/− mice had spontaneous subclinical kidney injury characterized by tubulointerstitial inflammation and increased Ngal expression. Upon AKI, Ppargc1a−/− mice had lower survival and more severe loss of renal function, tubular injury, and reduction in expression of mitochondrial PGC‐1α‐dependent genes in the kidney, and an earlier decrease in mitochondrial mass than WT mice. Additionally, surviving Ppargc1a−/− mice showed higher rates of tubular cell death, compensatory proliferation, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, NF‐κB activation, and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration. Specifically, Ppargc1a−/− mice displayed increased M1 and decreased M2 responses and expression of the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10. In cultured renal tubular cells, PGC‐1α targeting promoted spontaneous cell death and proinflammatory responses. In conclusion, PGC‐1α inactivation is a key driver of the gene expression response in nephrotoxic AKI and PGC‐1α deficiency promotes a spontaneous inflammatory kidney response that is magnified during AKI. Rheological and physical characterization of PEDOT: PSS/graphene oxide nanocomposites for perovskite solar cells In this work, the influence of graphene oxide (GO) doped poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin nanocomposite on an indiumâ\\x80\\x93tin-oxide (ITO) anode, as hole transport layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, was investigated. Different concentrations of GO were added into the PEDOT:PSS in order to enhance its conductivity. In particular, the influence of GO content on the rheological and thermal properties of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/GO nanocomposites was initially examined. The GO filler was prepared by using modified Hummers method and dispersed into PEDOT:PSS in different quantity (ranging from 0.05 to 0.25%wt/wt). The obtained nanocomposite solutions were analyzed by rheological characterizations in order to evaluate the influence of the GO filler on the viscosity of the PEDOT:PSS matrix. The wettability of solutions was evaluated by Contact Angle (CA) measurements. The quality of GO dispersion into the polymer matrix was studied using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Thermal characterizations (DSC and TGA) were, finally, applied on nanocomposite films in order to evaluate thermal stability of the films as well as to indirectly comprehend the GO influence on PEDOT:PSS-water links.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Ubiquitin in Alzheimer\\'s Disease and Parkinsonian Disorders 1 Purpose Dysfunctional proteostasis, with decreased protein degradation and an accumulation of ubiquitin into aggregated protein inclusions, is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Identifying new potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflecting this process could contribute important information on pathophysiology. 2 Experimental design A developed method combining SPE and PRM‐MS is employed to monitor the concentration of ubiquitin in CSF from subjects with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD), Parkinson\\'s disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Four independent cross‐sectional studies are conducted, studies 1–4, including controls (n = 86) and participants with AD (n = 60), PD (n = 15), and PSP (n = 11). 3 Results The method shows a repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 6.1 and 7.9%, respectively. The determined LOD is 0.1 nm and the LOQ range between 0.625 and 80 nm. The CSF ubiquitin concentration is 1.2–1.5‐fold higher in AD patients compared with controls in the three independent AD‐control studies (Study 1, p < 0.001; Study 2, p < 0.001; and Study 3, p = 0.003). In the fourth study, there is no difference in PD or PSP, compared to controls. 4 Conclusion and clinical relevance CSF ubiquitin may reflect dysfunctional proteostasis in AD. The described method can be used for further exploration of ubiquitin as a potential biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurotensin, substance P, and insulin enhance cell migration Neurotensin, substance P, and insulin have been demonstrated to improve wound healing in vivo. However, the mechanism behind their effect is still not fully understood. This study investigates the effects leading to enhanced scratch closure by these peptides in vitro. The skin keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, was used to test scratch closure effects of the peptides and alterations of cytokine levels. HUVEC cells were used to test the angiogenic effect of the peptides. Furthermore, clinical isolates of Staphylococcus lugdunensis were used to examine the potential antimicrobial activity of each peptide. Our results demonstrate that neurotensin, substance P, and insulin had significant migratory effects in scratch assays were neurotensin had the lowest effect. Furthermore, we investigated use of the peptides in combination. When substance P was used in combination with neurotensin, the cell migratory capacity was decreased, and the peptides showed a negative correlation (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.298, P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Neurotensin and insulin significantly increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) secreted from white blood cells, whereas substance P showed a tendency. Interestingly, neurotensin increased the level of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 significantly compared to substance P (P\\xa0<\\xa0.01). Additionally, the peptides decreased TNFα mRNA levels (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) in HaCaT cells, whereas only neurotensin and insulin decreased IL-8 mRNA (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) but had no significant effect on IL-6 mRNA levels. Surprisingly, substance P increased IL-6 mRNA 9-fold (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the peptides increased angiogenesis in the HUVEC cells (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Finally, S. lugdunensis isolates were not susceptible to the peptides. We demonstrate that the peptides worked differently on HaCaT cells, but substance P acted differently than neurotensin on cytokine levels expression as well as on migration of HaCaT cells. On the contrary, neurotensin and insulin worked similarly. All of these aspects are crucial for proper wound healing, and the results suggest multiple mechanisms for wound-healing properties of these peptides. Physiologically‐Based Pharmacokinetic Models for\\n            CYP\\n            1A2 Drug–Drug Interaction Prediction: A Modeling Network of Fluvoxamine, Theophylline, Caffeine, Rifampicin, and Midazolam This study provides whole‐body physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic models of the strong index cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2 inhibitor and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluvoxamine and of the sensitive CYP1A2 substrate theophylline. Both models were built and thoroughly evaluated for their application in drug–drug interaction (DDI) prediction in a network of perpetrator and victim drugs, combining them with previously developed models of caffeine (sensitive index CYP1A2 substrate), rifampicin (moderate CYP1A2 inducer), and midazolam (sensitive index CYP3A4 substrate). Simulation of all reported clinical DDI studies for combinations of these five drugs shows that the presented models reliably predict the observed drug concentrations, resulting in seven of eight of the predicted DDI area under the plasma curve (AUC) ratios (AUC during DDI/AUC control) and seven of seven of the predicted DDI peak plasma concentration (Cmax) ratios (Cmax during DDI/Cmax control) within twofold of the observed values. Therefore, the models are considered qualified for DDI prediction. All models are comprehensively documented and publicly available, as tools to support the drug development and clinical research community.

Towards a more reliable historical reanalysis: Improvements for version 3 of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis system Historical reanalyses that span more than a century are needed for a wide range of studies, from understanding large‐scale climate trends to diagnosing the impacts of individual historical extreme weather events. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub‐daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid‐19th century. These and other issues can reduce its effectiveness for studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA‐CIRES‐DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher‐resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble‐based estimates of confidence, removed spin‐up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea‐level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large‐scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time‐varying biases in southern high‐latitude pressure fields. Strong Improvement of Long-Term Chemical and Thermal Stability of Plasmonic Silver Nanoantennas and Films Silver (Ag) nanostructures and thin films are advantageous plasmonic materials as they have significantly lower losses than gold (Au). Unfortunately, Ag nanostructures suffer from poor chemical and thermal stability, which limit their applications. Here, the mechanisms leading to the deterioration of Ag nanostructures are clarified. It is first shown that oxygen alone cannot oxidize Ag nanostructures. Then, experiments using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the amount of sulfur in ambient air is too low for efficient tarnishing of the Ag surface. Finally, water is found to be the most critical factor for the degradation of Ag nanostructures and thin films. At high relative humidity, adsorbed water forms a thin film enabling the migration of Ag ions at the Ag/air interface, which deteriorates the Ag nanostructures. A dehydration treatment is developed which alters the morphology of the deposited silver, leading to an improved chemical and thermal stability of the Ag nanostructures and films, which then remain stable for more than 14 weeks under ambient laboratory conditions. In addition, dehydration also improves significantly the root-mean-square roughness for Ag thin films deposited on a glass substrate. Light-Induced Contraction/Expansion of 1D Photoswitchable Metallopolymer Monitored at the Solid-Liquid Interface The use of a bottom-up approach to the fabrication of nanopatterned functional surfaces, which are capable to respond to external stimuli, is of great current interest. Herein, the preparation of light-responsive, linear supramolecular metallopolymers constituted by the ideally infinite repetition of a ditopic ligand bearing an azoaryl moiety and Co(II) coordination nodes is described. The supramolecular polymerization process is followed by optical spectroscopy in dimethylformamide solution. Noteworthy, a submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of the in situ reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization of a photoswitchable metallopolymer that self-assembles into 2D crystalline patterns onto a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface is achieved for the first time. The STM analysis of the nanopatterned surfaces is corroborated by modeling the physisorbed species onto a graphene slab before and after irradiation by means of density functional theory calculation. Significantly, switching of the monolayers consisting of supramolecular Co(II) metallopolymer bearing trans-azoaryl units to a novel pattern based on cis isomers can be triggered by UV light and reversed back to the trans conformer by using visible light, thereby restoring the trans-based supramolecular 2D packing. These findings represent a step forward toward the design and preparation of photoresponsive “smart” surfaces organized with an atomic precision. Computational Methods Used in Hit-to-Lead and Lead Optimization Stages of Structure-Based Drug Discovery GPCR modeling approaches are widely used in the hit-to-lead (H2L) and lead optimization (LO) stages of drug discovery. The aims of these modeling approaches are to predict the 3D structures of the receptor-ligand complexes, to explore the key interactions between the receptor and the ligand and to utilize these insights in the design of new molecules with improved binding, selectivity or other pharmacological properties. In this book chapter, we present a brief survey of key computational approaches integrated with hierarchical GPCR modeling protocol (HGMP) used in hit-to-lead (H2L) and in lead optimization (LO) stages of structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). We outline the differences in modeling strategies used in H2L and LO of SBDD and\\xa0illustrate how these tools have been applied in three drug discovery projects. Holographic collisions in non-conformal theories We numerically simulate gravitational shock wave collisions in a holographic model dual to a non-conformal four-dimensional gauge theory. We find two novel effects associated to the non-zero bulk viscosity of the resulting plasma. First, the hydrodynamization time increases. Second, if the bulk viscosity is large enough then the plasma becomes well described by hydrodynamics before the energy density and the average pressure begin to obey the equilibrium equation of state. We discuss implications for the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collision experiments. Dynamics of phase separation from holography We use holography to develop a physical picture of the real-time evolution of the spinodal instability of a four-dimensional, strongly-coupled gauge theory with a first-order, thermal phase transition. We numerically solve Einstein\\'s equations to follow the evolution, in which we identify four generic stages: A first, linear stage in which the instability grows exponentially; a second, non-linear stage in which peaks and/or phase domains are formed; a third stage in which these structures merge; and a fourth stage in which the system finally relaxes to a static, phase-separated configuration. On the gravity side the latter is described by a static, stable, inhomogeneous horizon. We conjecture and provide evidence that all static, non-phase separated configurations in large enough boxes are dynamically unstable. We show that all four stages are well described by the constitutive relations of second-order hydrodynamics that include all second-order gradients that are purely spatial in the local rest frame. In contrast, a M\\\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type formulation of hydrodynamics fails to provide a good description for two reasons. First, it misses some large, purely-spatial gradient corrections. Second, several second-order transport coefficients in this formulation, including the relaxation times _$\\\\tau_\\\\pi_$ and _$\\\\tau_\\\\Pi_$, diverge at the points where the speed of sound vanishes. Phase transitions, inhomogeneous horizons and second-order hydrodynamics We use holography to study the spinodal instability of a four-dimensional, strongly-coupled gauge theory with a first-order thermal phase transition. We place the theory on a cylinder in a set of homogeneous, unstable initial states. The dual gravity configurations are black branes afflicted by a Gregory-Laflamme instability. We numerically evolve Einstein\\'s equations to follow the instability until the system settles down to a stationary, inhomogeneous black brane. The dual gauge theory states have constant temperature but non-constant energy density. We show that the time evolution of the instability and the final states are accurately described by second-order hydrodynamics. In the static limit, the latter reduces to a single, second-order, non-linear differential equation from which the inhomogeneous final states can be derived. Paths to equilibrium in non-conformal collisions We extend our previous analysis of holographic heavy ion collisions in non-conformal theories. We provide a detailed description of our numerical code. We study collisions at different energies in gauge theories with different degrees of non-conformality. We compare four relaxation times: the hydrodynamization time (when hydrodynamics becomes applicable), the EoSization time (when the average pressure approaches its equilibrium value), the isotropization time (when the longitudinal and transverse pressures approach each other) and the condensate relaxation time (when the expectation value of a scalar operator approaches its equilibrium value). We find that these processes can occur in several different orderings. In particular, the condensate can remain far from equilibrium even long after the plasma has hydrodynamized and EoSized. We also explore the rapidity distribution of the energy density at hydrodynamization. This is far from boost-invariant and its width decreases as the non-conformality increases. Nevertheless, the velocity field at hydrodynamization is almost exactly boost-invariant regardless of the non-conformality. This result may be used to constrain the initialization of hydrodynamic fields in heavy ion collisions. Thermodynamics, transport and relaxation in non-conformal theories We study the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of a holographic five-dimensional model consisting of Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The dual four-dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and, at zero temperature, exhibits a renormalisation group flow between two different fixed points. We quantify the deviations from conformality both in terms of thermodynamic observables and in terms of the bulk viscosity of the theory. The ratio of bulk over shear viscosity violates Buchel\\'s bound. We study relaxation of small-amplitude, homogeneous perturbations by computing the quasi-normal modes of the system at zero spatial momentum. In this approximation we identify two different relaxation channels. At high temperatures, the different pressures first become approximately equal to one another, and subsequently this average pressure evolves towards the equilibrium value dictated by the equation of state. At low temperatures, the average pressure first evolves towards the equilibrium pressure, and only later the different pressures become approximately equal to one another. The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees The gut microbiome is recognised as playing an integral role in the health and ecology of a wide variety of animal taxa. However, the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over 4 days. The gut bacterial communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that some core members of the unique honey bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results suggest an influence of task-related local environment exposure and diet on the honey bee gut microbial community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.

Serum endotrophin identifies optimal responders to PPARγ agonists in type 2 diabetes The treatment of type 2 diabetes with full peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists improves insulin sensitivity, but is associated with weight gain, heart failure, peripheral oedema and bone loss. Endotrophin, the C-terminal fragment of the α3 chain of procollagen type VI (also called Pro-C6), is involved in both adipose tissue matrix remodelling and metabolic control. We established a serum assay for endotrophin to assess if this novel adipokine could identify type 2 diabetic patients who respond optimally to PPARγ agonists, improving the risk-to-benefit ratio. The BALLET trial (NCT00515632) compared the glucose-lowering effects and safety of the partial PPARγ agonist balaglitazone with those of pioglitazone in individuals with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin therapy. The per protocol population (n\\u2009=\\u2009297) was stratified into tertiles based on baseline endotrophin levels. Participants were followed-up after 26\\xa0weeks, after which correlational analysis was carried out between endotrophin levels and measures of glucose control. This is a secondary post hoc analysis. Endotrophin was significantly associated with therapeutic response to balaglitazone and pioglitazone. At week 26, only individuals in the upper two tertiles showed significant reductions in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose compared with baseline. The OR for a 1% and a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c for individuals in the upper two tertiles were 3.83 (95% CI 1.62, 9.04) p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, and 3.85 (95% CI 1.94, 7.61) p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, respectively. Endotrophin levels correlated with adipose tissue mass, insulin resistance and fatty liver index. Notably, PPARγ-associated adverse effects, such as moderate-to-severe lower extremity oedema, only occurred in the lower tertile. Elevated endotrophin serum levels predict response to two insulin sensitisers and reduce the risk of associated adverse effects, thereby, identifying patients with type 2 diabetes who may profit from PPARγ agonist treatment. The heritable basis of gene–environment interactions in cardiometabolic traits Aims/hypothesis Little is known about the heritable basis of gene–environment interactions in humans. We therefore screened multiple cardiometabolic traits to assess the probability that they are influenced by genotype–environment interactions. Methods Fourteen established environmental risk exposures and 11 cardiometabolic traits were analysed in the VIKING study, a cohort of 16,430 Swedish adults from 1682 extended pedigrees with available detailed genealogical, phenotypic and demographic information, using a maximum likelihood variance decomposition method in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines software. Results All cardiometabolic traits had statistically significant heritability estimates, with narrow-sense heritabilities (h 2) ranging from 24% to 47%. Genotype–environment interactions were detected for age and sex (for the majority of traits), physical activity (for triacylglycerols, 2\\xa0h glucose and diastolic BP), smoking (for weight), alcohol intake (for weight, BMI and 2\\xa0h glucose) and diet pattern (for weight, BMI, glycaemic traits and systolic BP). Genotype–age interactions for weight and systolic BP, genotype–sex interactions for BMI and triacylglycerols and genotype–alcohol intake interactions for weight remained significant after multiple test correction. Conclusions/interpretation Age, sex and alcohol intake are likely to be major modifiers of genetic effects for a range of cardiometabolic traits. This information may prove valuable for studies that seek to identify specific loci that modify the effects of lifestyle in cardiometabolic disease.

Lifestyle and precision diabetes medicine: will genomics help optimise the prediction, prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle therapy? Precision diabetes medicine, the optimisation of therapy using patient-level biomarker data, has stimulated enormous interest throughout society as it provides hope of more effective, less costly and safer ways of preventing, treating, and perhaps even curing the disease. While precision diabetes medicine is often framed in the context of pharmacotherapy, using biomarkers to personalise lifestyle recommendations, intended to lower type 2 diabetes risk or to slow progression, is also conceivable. There are at least four ways in which this might work: (1) by helping to predict a person’s susceptibility to adverse lifestyle exposures; (2) by facilitating the stratification of type 2 diabetes into subclasses, some of which may be prevented or treated optimally with specific lifestyle interventions; (3) by aiding the discovery of prognostic biomarkers that help guide timing and intensity of lifestyle interventions; (4) by predicting treatment response. In this review we overview the rationale for precision diabetes medicine, specifically as it relates to lifestyle; we also scrutinise existing evidence, discuss the barriers germane to research in this field and consider how this work is likely to proceed.

Use of HOMA-IR to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a population-based and inter-laboratory study Aims/hypothesis: Recent European guidelines for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) call for reference values for HOMA-IR. In this study, we aimed to determine: (1) the upper limit of normal HOMA-IR in two population-based cohorts; (2) the HOMA-IR corresponding to NAFLD; (3) the effect of sex and PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409 on HOMA-IR; and (4) inter-laboratory variations in HOMA-IR. Methods: We identified healthy individuals in two population-based cohorts (FINRISK 2007 [n = 5024] and the Programme for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Finland [FIN-D2D; n = 2849]) to define the upper 95th percentile of HOMA-IR. Non-obese individuals with normal fasting glucose levels, no excessive alcohol use, no known diseases and no use of any drugs were considered healthy. The optimal HOMA-IR cut-off for NAFLD (liver fat ≥5.56%, based on the Dallas Heart Study) was determined in 368 non-diabetic individuals (35% with NAFLD), whose liver fat was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Samples from ten individuals were simultaneously analysed for HOMA-IR in seven European laboratories. Results: The upper 95th percentiles of HOMA-IR were 1.9 and 2.0 in healthy individuals in the FINRISK (n = 1167) and FIN-D2D (n = 459) cohorts. Sex or PNPLA3 genotype did not influence these values. The optimal HOMA-IR cut-off for NAFLD was 1.9 (sensitivity 87%, specificity 79%). A HOMA-IR of 2.0 corresponded to normal liver fat (<5.56% on 1H-MRS) in linear regression analysis. The 2.0 HOMA-IR measured in Helsinki corresponded to 1.3, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, 2.0 and 2.1 in six other laboratories. The inter-laboratory CV% of HOMA-IR was 25% due to inter-assay variation in insulin (25%) rather than glucose (5%) measurements.  Conclusions/interpretation: The upper limit of HOMA-IR in population-based cohorts closely corresponds to that of normal liver fat. Standardisation of insulin assays would be the first step towards definition of normal values for HOMA-IR. Discovery of biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration before and after the onset of type 2 diabetes: descriptive characteristics of the epidemiological studies within the IMI DIRECT Consortium Aims/hypothesis Here, we describe the characteristics of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification (DIRECT) epidemiological cohorts at baseline and follow-up examinations (18, 36 and 48\\xa0months of follow-up). Methods From a sampling frame of 24,682 adults of European ancestry enrolled in population-based cohorts across Europe, participants at varying risk of glycaemic deterioration were identified using a risk prediction algorithm (based on age, BMI, waist circumference, use of antihypertensive medication, smoking status and parental history of type 2 diabetes) and enrolled into a prospective cohort study (n\\u2009=\\u20092127) (cohort 1, prediabetes risk). We also recruited people from clinical registries with type 2 diabetes diagnosed 6–24\\xa0months previously (n\\u2009=\\u2009789) into a second cohort study (cohort 2, diabetes). Follow-up examinations took place at ~18\\xa0months (both cohorts) and at ~48\\xa0months (cohort 1) or ~36\\xa0months (cohort 2) after baseline examinations. The cohorts were studied in parallel using matched protocols across seven clinical centres in northern Europe. Results Using ADA 2011 glycaemic categories, 33% (n\\u2009=\\u2009693) of cohort 1 (prediabetes risk) had normal glucose regulation and 67% (n\\u2009=\\u20091419) had impaired glucose regulation. Seventy-six per cent of participants in cohort 1 was male. Cohort 1 participants had the following characteristics (mean\\u2009±\\u2009SD) at baseline: age 62 (6.2) years; BMI 27.9 (4.0) kg/m2; fasting glucose 5.7 (0.6) mmol/l; 2\\xa0h glucose 5.9 (1.6) mmol/l. At the final follow-up examination the participants’ clinical characteristics were as follows: fasting glucose 6.0 (0.6) mmol/l; 2\\xa0h OGTT glucose 6.5 (2.0) mmol/l. In cohort 2 (diabetes), 66% (n\\u2009=\\u2009517) were treated by lifestyle modification and 34% (n\\u2009=\\u2009272) were treated with metformin plus lifestyle modification at enrolment. Fifty-eight per cent of participants in cohort 2 was male. Cohort 2 participants had the following characteristics at baseline: age 62 (8.1) years; BMI 30.5 (5.0) kg/m2; fasting glucose 7.2 (1.4) mmol/l; 2\\xa0h glucose 8.6 (2.8) mmol/l. At the final follow-up examination, the participants’ clinical characteristics were as follows: fasting glucose 7.9 (2.0) mmol/l; 2\\xa0h mixed-meal tolerance test glucose 9.9 (3.4) mmol/l. Conclusions/interpretation The IMI DIRECT cohorts are intensely characterised, with a wide-variety of metabolically relevant measures assessed prospectively. We anticipate that the cohorts, made available through managed access, will provide a powerful resource for biomarker discovery, multivariate aetiological analyses and reclassification of patients for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Structure and function of multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) and their relevance to drug therapy and personalized medicine Multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE; SLC47A) proteins are membrane transporters mediating the excretion of organic cations and zwitterions into bile and urine and thereby contributing to the hepatic and renal elimination of many xenobiotics. Transported substrates include creatinine as endogenous substrate, the vitamin thiamine and a number of drug agents with in part chemically different structures such as the antidiabetic metformin, the antiviral agents acyclovir and ganciclovir as well as the antibiotics cephalexin and cephradine. This review summarizes current knowledge on the structural and molecular features of human MATE transporters including data on expression and localization in different tissues, important aspects on regulation and their functional role in drug transport. The role of genetic variation of MATE proteins for drug pharmacokinetics and drug response will be discussed with consequences for personalized medicine. Methyleugenol DNA adducts in human liver are associated with SULT1A1 copy number variations and expression levels Methyleugenol is a rodent hepatocarcinogen occurring in many herbs and spices as well as essential oils used for flavoring. Following metabolic activation by cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs), methyleugenol can form DNA adducts. Previously, we showed that DNA adduct formation by methyleugenol in mouse liver is dependent on SULT1A1 expression and that methyleugenol DNA adducts are abundant in human liver specimens. In humans, SULT1A1 activity is affected by genetic polymorphisms, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). Here we investigated the relationship between individual methyleugenol DNA adduct levels and SULT1A1 in human liver samples. Using isotope-dilution ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we quantified methyleugenol DNA adducts in 121 human surgical liver samples. Frequent CNVs, including deletions (f = 3.3%) and duplications (f = 36.4%) of SULT1A1, were identified using qPCR and TaqMan assays in the donors’ genomic DNA. SULT1A1 mRNA and protein levels were quantified using microarray data and Western blot analysis, respectively. Methyleugenol DNA adducts were detected in all 121 liver samples studied. Their levels varied 122-fold between individuals and were significantly correlated to both mRNA and protein levels of SULT1A1 (r s = 0.43, and r s = 0.44, respectively). Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis identified significant associations of SULT1A1 CNVs with mRNA (p = 1.7 × 10−06) and protein (p = 4.4 × 10− 10) levels as well as methyleugenol DNA adduct levels (p = 0.003). These data establish the importance of SULT1A1 genotype for hepatic methyleugenol DNA adducts in humans, and they confirm a strong impact of SULT1A1 CNVs on SULT1A1 hepatic phenotype. Identification of approved drugs as potent inhibitors of pregnane X receptor activation with differential receptor interaction profiles Activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) results in the induction of first-pass metabolism and drug efflux. Hereby, PXR may cause adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure of drugs. PXR inhibition is thus an attractive option to minimise adverse effects or to improve therapeutic efficiencies; however, only a limited number of antagonists have been identified so far. We performed a cell-based high-throughput screen to identify PXR antagonists, using a library of approved and investigational drugs. Two approved drugs, pimecrolimus and pazopanib, emerged as novel potent antagonists of PXR activation, with IC50 values of 1.2 and 4.1\\xa0µM, respectively. We further characterised these with respect to receptor specificity, assembly of the PXR ligand-binding domain (LBD) and interactions with co-factors. In vitro and in silico assays were carried out to identify the site(s) of interaction with the PXR LBD. Primary human hepatocytes were used to investigate antagonism of the induction of endogenous PXR target genes. Pimecrolimus and pazopanib did not affect the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors. Both induced the release of co-repressor from PXR and likewise interfered with agonist-induced recruitment of co-activator. Cumulative evidence from cellular and in vitro assays, as well as molecular docking, suggested additional or exclusive binding outside the PXR ligand-binding pocket for both. The compounds differentially antagonised the induction of PXR-regulated genes by rifampicin in primary human hepatocytes. In conclusion, we here have identified two approved drugs as novel potent PXR inhibitors with differential receptor interaction profiles and gene selectivity in primary human hepatocytes. Automatic quantification of tenosynovitis on MRI of the wrist in patients with early arthritis: a feasibility study Objectives: Tenosynovitis (inflammation of the synovial lining of the sheath surrounding tendons) is frequently observed on MRI of early arthritis patients. Since visual assessment of tenosynovitis is a laborious task, we investigated the feasibility of automatic quantification of tenosynovitis on MRI of the wrist in a large cohort of early arthritis patients. Methods: For 563 consecutive early arthritis patients (clinically confirmed arthritis ≥ 1 joint, symptoms < 2\\xa0years), MR scans of the wrist were processed in three automatic stages. First, super-resolution reconstruction was applied to fuse coronal and axial scans into a single high-resolution three-dimensional image. Next, 10 extensor/flexor tendon regions were segmented using atlas-based segmentation and marker-based watershed. A measurement region of interest (ROI) was defined around the tendons. Finally, tenosynovitis was quantified by identifying image intensity values associated with tenosynovial inflammation using fuzzy clustering and measuring the fraction of voxels with these characteristic intensities within the measurement ROI. A subset of 60 patients was used for training and the remaining 503 patients for validation. Correlation between quantitative measurements and visual scores was assessed through Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Pearson correlation between quantitative measurements and visual scores across 503 patients was r = 0.90, p\\xa0< 0.001. False detections due to blood vessels and synovitis present within the measurement ROI contributed to a median offset from zero equivalent to 13.8% of the largest measurement value. Conclusion: Quantitative measurement of tenosynovitis on MRI of the wrist is feasible and largely consistent with visual scores. Further improvements in segmentation and exclusion of false detections are warranted. Key Points: • Automatic measurement of tenosynovitis on MRI of the wrist is feasible and largely consistent with visual scores. • Blood vessels and synovitis in the vicinity of evaluated tendons can contribute to false detections in automatic measurements. • Further improvements in segmentation and exclusion of false detections are important directions of future work on the path to a robust quantification framework. Global modeling of tropical cyclone storm surges using high-resolution forecasts We assess the suitability of ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) data for the global modeling of tropical cyclone (TC) storm surges. We extract meteorological forcing from the IFS at a 0.225° horizontal resolution for eight historical TCs and simulate the corresponding surges using the global tide and surge model. Maximum surge heights for Hurricanes Irma and Sandy are compared with tide gauge observations, with R 2 -values of 0.86 and 0.74 respectively. Maximum surge heights for the other TCs are in line with literature. Our case studies demonstrate that a horizontal resolution of 0.225° is sufficient for the large-scale modeling of TC surges. By upscaling the meteorological forcing to coarser resolutions as low as 1.0°, we assess the effects of horizontal resolution on the performance of surge modeling. We demonstrate that coarser resolutions result in lower-modeled surges for all case studies, with modeled surges up to 1\\xa0m lower for Irma and Nargis. The largest differences in surges between the different resolutions are found for the TCs with the highest surges. We discuss possible drivers of maximum surge heights (TC size, intensity, and coastal slope and complexity), and find that coastal complexity and slope play a more profound role than TC size and intensity alone. The highest surges are found in areas with complex coastlines (fractal dimension > 1.10) and, in general, shallow coastlines. Our findings show that using high-resolution meteorological forcing is particularly beneficial for areas prone to high TC surges, since these surges are reduced the most in coarse-resolution datasets. How Gulf-Stream SST-fronts influence Atlantic winter storms The strong horizontal gradients in sea surface temperature (SST) of the Atlantic Gulf Stream exert a detectable influence on extratropical cyclones propagating across the region. This is shown in a sensitivity experiment where 24 winter storms taken from ERA-Interim are simulated with HARMONIE at 10-km resolution. Each storm is simulated twice. First, using observed SST (REF). In the second simulation a smoothed SST is offered (SMTH), while lateral and upper-level boundary conditions are unmodified. Each storm pair propagates approximately along the same track, however their intensities (as measured by maximal near-surface wind speed or 850-hPa relative vorticity) differ up to ± 25%. A 30-member ensemble created for one of the storms shows that on a single-storm level the response is systematic rather than random. To explain the broad response in storm strength, we show that the SST-adjustment modifies two environmental parameters: surface latent heat flux (LHF) and low-level baroclinicity (B). LHF influences storms by modifying diabatic heating and boundary-layer processes such as vertical mixing. The position of each storm’s track relative to the SST-front is important. South of the SST-front the smoothing leads to lower SST, reduced LHF and storms with generally weaker maximum near-surface winds. North of the SST-front the increased LHF tend to enhance the winds, but the accompanying changes in baroclinicity are not necessarily favourable. Together these mechanisms explain up to 80% of the variability in the near-surface maximal wind speed change. Because the mechanisms are less effective in explaining more dynamics-oriented indicators like 850 hPa relative vorticity, we hypothesise that part of the wind-speed change is related to adjustment of the boundary-layer processes in response to the LHF and B changes. A first-of-its-kind multi-model convection permitting ensemble for investigating convective phenomena over Europe and the Mediterranean A recently launched project under the auspices of the World Climate Research Program’s (WCRP) Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiments Flagship Pilot Studies program (CORDEX-FPS) is presented. This initiative aims to build first-of-its-kind ensemble climate experiments of convection permitting models to investigate present and future convective processes and related extremes over Europe and the Mediterranean. In this manuscript the rationale, scientific aims and approaches are presented along with some preliminary results from the testing phase of the project. Three test cases were selected in order to obtain a first look at the ensemble performance. The test cases covered a summertime extreme precipitation event over Austria, a fall Foehn event over the Swiss Alps and an intensively documented fall event along the Mediterranean coast. The test cases were run in both “weather-like” (WL, initialized just before the event in question) and “climate” (CM, initialized 1 month before the event) modes. Ensembles of 18–21 members, representing six different modeling systems with different physics and modelling chain options, was generated for the test cases (27 modeling teams have committed to perform the longer climate simulations). Results indicate that, when run in WL mode, the ensemble captures all three events quite well with ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.67, 0.82 and 0.91. They suggest that the more the event is driven by large-scale conditions, the closer the agreement between the ensemble members. Even in climate mode the large-scale driven events over the Swiss Alps and the Mediterranean coasts are still captured (ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.90 and 0.62, respectively), but the inter-model spread increases as expected. In the case over Mediterranean the effects of local-scale interactions between flow and orography and land–ocean contrasts are readily apparent. However, there is a much larger, though not surprising, increase in the spread for the Austrian event, which was weakly forced by the large-scale flow. Though the ensemble correlation skill score is still quite high (0.80). The preliminary results illustrate both the promise and the challenges that convection permitting modeling faces and make a strong argument for an ensemble-based approach to investigating high impact convective processes. Multi-model evaluation of the sensitivity of the global energy budget and hydrological cycle to resolution This study undertakes a multi-model comparison with the aim to describe and quantify systematic changes of the global energy and water budgets when the horizontal resolution of atmospheric models is increased and to identify common factors of these changes among models. To do so, we analyse an ensemble of twelve atmosphere-only and six coupled GCMs, with different model formulations and with resolutions spanning those of state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, i.e. from resolutions coarser than 100\\xa0km to resolutions finer than 25\\xa0km. The main changes in the global energy budget with resolution are a systematic increase in outgoing longwave radiation and decrease in outgoing shortwave radiation due to changes in cloud properties, and a systematic increase in surface latent heat flux; when resolution is increased from 100 to 25\\xa0km, the magnitude of the change of those fluxes can be as large as 5\\xa0W\\xa0m−2. Moreover, all but one atmosphere-only model simulate a decrease of the poleward energy transport at higher resolution, mainly explained by a reduction of the equator-to-pole tropospheric temperature gradient. Regarding hydrological processes, our results are the following: (1) there is an increase of global precipitation with increasing resolution in all models (up to 40\\u2009×\\u2009103 km3\\xa0year−1) but the partitioning between land and ocean varies among models; (2) the fraction of total precipitation that falls on land is on average 10% larger at higher resolution in grid point models, but it is smaller\\xa0at higher resolution in spectral models; (3) grid points models simulate an increase of the fraction of land precipitation due to moisture convergence twice as large as in spectral models; (4) grid point models, which have a better resolved orography, show an increase of orographic precipitation of up to 13\\u2009×\\u2009103 km3\\xa0year−1 which explains most of the change in land precipitation; (5) at the regional scale, precipitation pattern and amplitude are improved with increased resolution due to a better simulated seasonal mean circulation. We discuss our results against several observational estimates of the Earth\\'s\\xa0energy budget and hydrological cycle and show\\xa0that they support recent high estimates of global precipitation. Bias adjustment and ensemble recalibration methods for seasonal forecasting: a comprehensive intercomparison using the C3S dataset This work presents a comprehensive intercomparison of different alternatives for the calibration of seasonal forecasts, ranging from simple bias adjustment (BA)—e.g. quantile mapping—to more sophisticated ensemble recalibration (RC) methods—e.g. non-homogeneous Gaussian regression, which build on the temporal correspondence between the climate model and the corresponding observations to generate reliable predictions. To be as critical as possible, we validate the raw model and the calibrated forecasts in terms of a number of metrics which take into account different aspects of forecast quality (association, accuracy, discrimination and reliability). We focus on one-month lead forecasts of precipitation and temperature from four state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting systems, three of them included in the Copernicus Climate Change Service dataset (ECMWF-SEAS5, UK Met Office-GloSea5 and Météo France-System5) for boreal winter and summer over two illustrative regions with different skill characteristics (Europe and Southeast Asia). Our results indicate that both BA and RC methods effectively correct the large raw model biases, which is of paramount importance for users, particularly when directly using the climate model outputs to run impact models, or when computing climate indices depending on absolute values/thresholds. However, except for particular regions and/or seasons (typically with high skill), there is only marginal added value—with respect to the raw model outputs—beyond this bias removal. For those cases, RC methods can outperform BA ones, mostly due to an improvement in reliability. Finally, we also show that whereas an increase in the number of members only modestly affects the results obtained from calibration, longer hindcast periods lead to improved forecast quality, particularly for RC methods. Robustness of European climate projections from dynamical downscaling How climate change will unfold in the years to come is a central topic in today’s environmental debate, in particular at the regional level. While projections using large ensembles of global climate models consistently indicate a future decrease in summer precipitation over southern Europe and an increase over northern Europe, individual models substantially modulate these distinct signals of change in precipitation. So far model improvements and higher resolution from regional downscaling have not been seen as able to resolve these disagreements. In this paper we assess whether 2\\xa0decades of investments in large ensembles of downscaling experiments with regional climate model simulations for Europe have contributed to a more robust model assessment of the future climate at a range of geographical scales. We study climate change projections of European seasonal temperature and precipitation using an ensemble-suite comprised by all readily available pan-European regional model projections for the twenty-first-century, representing increasing model resolution from ~ 50 to ~ 12\\xa0km grid distance, as well as lateral boundary and sea surface temperature conditions from a variety of global model simulations. Employing a simple scaling with global mean temperature change we identify emerging robust signals of future seasonal temperature and precipitation changes also found to resemble current observed trends, where these are judged to be statistically significant. Impact of model resolution on Arctic sea ice and North Atlantic Ocean heat transport Arctic sea-ice area and volume have substantially decreased since the beginning of the satellite era. Concurrently, the poleward heat transport from the North Atlantic Ocean into the Arctic has increased, partly contributing to the loss of sea ice. Increasing the horizontal resolution of general circulation models (GCMs) improves their ability to represent the complex interplay of processes at high latitudes. Here, we investigate the impact of model resolution on Arctic sea ice and Atlantic Ocean heat transport (OHT) by using five different state-of-the-art coupled GCMs (12 model configurations in total) that include dynamic representations of the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice. The models participate in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Model results over the period 1950–2014 are compared to different observational datasets. In the models studied, a finer ocean resolution drives lower Arctic sea-ice area and volume and generally enhances Atlantic OHT. The representation of ocean surface characteristics, such as sea-surface temperature (SST) and velocity, is greatly improved by using a finer ocean resolution. This study highlights a clear anticorrelation at interannual time scales between Arctic sea ice (area and volume) and Atlantic OHT north of _$_$60\\\\,^\\\\circ \\\\hbox {N}_$_$ in the models studied. However, the strength of this relationship is not systematically impacted by model resolution. The higher the latitude to compute OHT, the stronger the relationship between sea-ice area/volume and OHT. Sea ice in the Barents/Kara and Greenland–Iceland–Norwegian (GIN) Seas is more strongly connected to Atlantic OHT than other Arctic seas. A new mathematical framework for atmospheric blocking events We use a simple yet Earth-like atmospheric model to propose a new framework for understanding the mathematics of blocking events. Analysing error growth rates along a very long model trajectory, we show that blockings are associated with conditions of anomalously high instability of the atmosphere. Additionally, the lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with the intensity of such an anomaly, against intuition. In the case of Atlantic blockings, predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the blocking, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the mature phase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability is lowest in the mature phase. We associate blockings to a specific class of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes of variability that cover the attractor of the system. The UPOs differ substantially in terms of instability, which explains the diversity of the atmosphere in terms predictability. The UPOs associated to blockings are indeed anomalously unstable, which leads to them being rarely visited. The onset of a blocking takes place when the trajectory of the system hops into the neighbourhood of one of these special UPOs. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood of usual, less unstable UPOs associated with zonal flow. This justifies the classical Markov chains-based analysis of transitions between weather regimes. The existence of UPOs differing in the dimensionality of their unstable manifold indicates a very strong violation of hyperbolicity in the model, which leads to a lack of structural stability. We propose that this is could be a generic feature of atmospheric models and might be a fundamental cause behind difficulties in representing blockings for the current climate and uncertainties in predicting how their statistics will change as a result of climate change. Large discrepancies in summer climate change over Europe as projected by global and regional climate models: causes and consequences We assess the differences of future climate changes over Europe in summer as projected by state-of-the-art regional climate models (RCM, from the EURO-Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) and by their forcing global climate models (GCM, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) and study the associated physical mechanisms. We show that important discrepancies at large-scales exist between global and regional projections. The RCMs project at the end of the 21st century over a large area of Europe a summer warming 1.5–2 K colder, and a much smaller decrease of precipitation of 5%, versus 20% in their driving GCMs. The RCMs generally simulate a much smaller increase in shortwave radiation at surface, which directly impacts surface temperature. In addition to differences in cloud cover changes, the absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in most regional simulations plays a major role in the differences of solar radiation changes. We confirm this result with twin regional simulations with and without time-varying anthropogenic aerosols. Additionally, the RCMs simulate larger increases in evapotranspiration over the Mediterranean sea and larger increases/smaller decreases over land, which contribute to smaller changes in relative humidity, with likely impacts on clouds and precipitation changes. Several potential causes of these differences in evapotranspiration changes are discussed. Overall, this work suggests that the current EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble does not capture the upper part of the climate change uncertainty range, with important implications for impact studies and the adaptation policies that they inform. Dynamical and thermodynamical drivers of variability in European summer heat extremes AbstractWe use the 100-member Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to disentangle the contributions from colocated dynamic atmospheric conditions and local thermodynamic effects of moisture limitation as drivers of variability in European summer heat extremes. Using a novel extreme event definition, we find that heat extremes with respect to the evolving mean climate increase by 70% under a moderate warming scenario during the twenty-first century. With a multiple regression approach, we find that the dynamical mechanisms representing blocking and anticyclonic conditions are the main driver of variability in extreme European summer temperatures, both in past and future climates. By contrast, local thermodynamic drivers play a secondary role in explaining the total variability in extreme temperatures. We also find that considering both dynamical and thermodynamical sources of variability simultaneously is crucial. Assessing only one type of drivers leads to an overestimation of their effect on extreme temperatures, particularly when considering only thermodynamical drivers. Lastly, we find that although most past and future heat extremes occur under favorable dynamical atmospheric conditions; this occurs 10–40% less frequently over Central Europe in the twenty-first century. By contrast, heat extremes over Central Europe occur 40% more frequently under concurrent extreme moisture limitation in the twenty-first Century. Our findings highlight a new type of neutral-atmosphere, moisture-driven heat extremes, and confirm that the increase in European heat extremes and associated variability increase are dominated by the local thermodynamic effect of moisture limitation. Coding and non-coding variants in the SHOX2 gene in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia with a strong genetic component. Molecular pathways involving the homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 control the development and function of the cardiac conduction system in mouse and zebrafish. Here we report the analysis of human SHOX2 as a potential susceptibility gene for early-onset AF. To identify causal variants and define the underlying mechanisms, results from 378 patients with early-onset AF before the age of 60\\xa0years were analyzed and compared to 1870 controls or reference datasets. We identified two missense mutations (p.G81E, p.H283Q), that were predicted as damaging. Transactivation studies using SHOX2 targets and phenotypic rescue experiments in zebrafish demonstrated that the p.H283Q mutation severely affects SHOX2 pacemaker function. We also demonstrate an association between a 3′UTR variant c.*28T>C of SHOX2 and AF (p\\xa0=\\xa00.00515). Patients carrying this variant present significantly longer PR intervals. Mechanistically, this variant creates a functional binding site for hsa-miR-92b-5p. Circulating hsa-miR-92b-5p plasma levels were significantly altered in AF patients carrying the 3′UTR variant (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0095). Finally, we demonstrate significantly reduced SHOX2 expression levels in right atrial appendages of AF patients compared to patients with sinus rhythm. Together, these results suggest a genetic contribution of SHOX2 in early-onset AF.

A nonsynonymous mutation in PLCG2 reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal dementia, and increases the likelihood of longevity The genetic variant rs72824905-G (minor allele) in the PLCG2 gene was previously associated with a reduced Alzheimer\\'s disease risk (AD). The role of PLCG2 in immune system signaling suggests it may also protect against other neurodegenerative diseases and possibly associates with longevity. We studied the effect of the rs72824905-G on seven neurodegenerative diseases and longevity, using 53,627 patients, 3,516 long-lived individuals and 149,290 study-matched controls. We replicated the association of rs72824905-G with reduced AD risk and we found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson\\'s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, despite adequate sample sizes. Conversely, the rs72824905-G allele was associated with increased likelihood of longevity. By-proxy analyses in the UK Biobank supported the associations with both dementia and longevity. Concluding, rs72824905-G has a protective effect against multiple neurodegenerative diseases indicating shared aspects of disease etiology. Our findings merit studying the PLCγ2 pathway as drug-target. NFL is a marker of treatment response in children with SMA treated with nusinersen BACKGROUND: Recently, the anti-sense oligonucleotide drug nusinersen was approved for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and our aim was to find a response marker for this treatment. METHODS: Twelve children with SMA type 1 and two copies of the SMN2 gene were included in a consecutive single-center study. The children were sampled for CSF at baseline and every time nusinersen was given intrathecally. The neuronal biomarkers NFL and tau and the glial biomarker GFAP were measured. Motor function was assessed using CHOP INTEND. Eleven similarly aged children, who were investigated to rule out neurological or infectious disease, were used as controls. RESULTS: Baseline levels of NFL (4598\\u2009±\\u2009981 vs 148\\u2009±\\u200939, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), tau (939\\u2009±\\u2009159 vs 404\\u2009±\\u200986, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), and GFAP (236\\u2009±\\u200944 vs 108\\u2009±\\u200926, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) were significantly higher in SMA children than controls. Motor function improved by nusinersen treatment in median 13 points corresponding to 5.4 points per month of treatment (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001). NFL levels typically normalized (\\u2009<\\u2009380\\xa0pg/ml) between the fourth and fifth doses [-\\u2009879.5\\xa0pg/mL/dose, 95% CI (-\\u20091243.4, -\\u2009415.6), P\\u2009=\\u20090.0001], tau levels decreased [-\\u2009112.6\\xa0pg/mL/dose, 95% CI (-\\u2009206-7, -\\u200918.6), P\\u2009=\\u20090.01], and minor decreases in GFAP were observed [-\\u200916.9\\xa0pg/mL/dose, 95% CI (-\\u200922.8, -\\u200911.2), P\\u2009=\\u20090.02] by nusinersen treatment. Improvement in motor function correlated with reduced concentrations of NFL (rho\\u2009=\\u2009-\\u20090.64, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) and tau (rho\\u2009=\\u2009-\\u20090.85, P\\u2009=\\u20090.0008) but not GFAP. CONCLUSIONS: Nusinersen normalized the axonal damage marker NFL and correlated with motor improvement in children with SMA. NFL may, therefore, be a novel biomarker to monitor treatment response early in the disease course. Low sun exposure increases multiple sclerosis risk both directly and indirectly Objective We aimed to study (1) to what extent the influence of low sun exposure on multiple sclerosis (MS) risk is mediated by low vitamin D levels; (2) whether low sun exposure or vitamin D deficiency act synergistically with HLA-DRB1*15:01 and absence of HLA-A*02:01. Methods We used two population-based case–control studies (7069 cases, 6632 matched controls). Subjects with different HLA alleles, sun exposure habits and vitamin D status were compared regarding MS risk, by calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) employing logistic regression. Mediation analysis was used to identify the potential mediation effect of vitamin D on the relationship between low sun exposure and MS risk. Results Low sun exposure increased MS risk directly as well as indirectly, by affecting vitamin D status. The direct effect, expressed as OR, was 1.26 (95% CI 1.04–1.45) and the indirect effect, mediated by vitamin D deficiency, was 1.10 (95% CI 1.02–1.23). Of the total effect, nearly 30% was mediated by vitamin D deficiency. There was a significant interaction between low sun exposure and vitamin D deficiency (attributable proportion due to interaction 0.3, 95% CI 0.04–0.5) accounting for about 12% of the total effect. Further, both factors interacted with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. Interpretation Our findings indicate that low sun exposure acts both directly on MS risk as well as indirectly, by leading to low vitamin D levels. The protective effect of sun exposure thus seems to involve both vitamin D and non-vitamin D pathways, which is of relevance for prevention, in particular for those with a genetic susceptibility to MS.

Validity of the Polar V800 monitor for measuring heart rate variability in mountain running route conditions Purpose This study was conducted to test, in mountain running route conditions, the accuracy of the Polar V800™ monitor as a suitable device for monitoring the heart rate variability (HRV) of runners. Method Eighteen healthy subjects ran a route that included a range of running slopes such as those encountered in trail and ultra-trail races. The comparative study of a V800 and a Holter SEER 12 ECG Recorder™ included the analysis of RR time series and short-term HRV analysis. A correction algorithm was designed to obtain the corrected Polar RR intervals. Six 5-min segments related to different running slopes were considered for each subject. Results The correlation between corrected V800 RR intervals and Holter RR intervals was very high (r¿=¿0.99, p¿<¿0.001), and the bias was less than 1 ms. The limits of agreement (LoA) obtained for SDNN and RMSSD were (-¿0.25 to 0.32 ms) and (-¿0.90 to 1.08 ms), respectively. The effect size (ES) obtained in the time domain HRV parameters was considered small (ES¿<¿0.2). Frequency domain HRV parameters did not differ (p¿>¿0.05) and were well correlated (r¿=¿0.96, p¿<¿0.001). Conclusion Narrow limits of agreement, high correlations and small effect size suggest that the Polar V800 is a valid tool for the analysis of heart rate variability in athletes while running high endurance events such as marathon, trail, and ultra-trail races. The genetic landscape of the human solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamily Abstract The human solute carrier (SLC) superfamily of transporters is comprised of over 400 membrane-bound proteins, and plays essential roles in a multitude of physiological and pharmacological processes. In addition, perturbation of SLC transporter function underlies numerous human diseases, which renders SLC transporters attractive drug targets. Common genetic polymorphisms in SLC genes have been associated with inter-individual differences in drug efficacy and toxicity. However, despite their tremendous clinical relevance, epidemiological data of these variants are mostly derived from heterogeneous cohorts of small sample size and the genetic SLC landscape beyond these common variants has not been comprehensively assessed. In this study, we analyzed Next-Generation Sequencing data from 141,456 individuals from seven major human populations to evaluate genetic variability, its functional consequences, and ethnogeographic patterns across the entire SLC superfamily of transporters. Importantly, of the 204,287 exonic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) which we identified, 99.8% were present in less than 1% of analyzed alleles. Comprehensive computational analyses using 13 partially orthogonal algorithms that predict the functional impact of genetic variations based on sequence information, evolutionary conservation, structural considerations, and functional genomics data revealed that each individual genome harbors 29.7 variants with putative\\xa0functional effects, of which rare variants account for 18%. Inter-ethnic variability was found to be extensive, and 83% of deleterious SLC variants were only identified in a single population. Interestingly, population-specific carrier frequencies of loss-of-function variants in SLC genes associated with recessive Mendelian disease recapitulated the ethnogeographic variation of the corresponding disorders, including cystinuria in Jewish individuals, type II citrullinemia in East Asians, and lysinuric protein intolerance in Finns, thus providing a powerful resource for clinical geneticists to inform about population-specific prevalence and allelic composition of Mendelian SLC diseases. In summary, we present the most comprehensive data set of SLC variability published to date, which can provide insights into inter-individual differences in SLC transporter function and guide the optimization of population-specific genotyping strategies in the bourgeoning fields of personalized medicine and precision public health. Copy number variation profiling in pharmacogenes using panel-based exome resequencing and correlation to human liver expression Structural variants including copy number variations (CNV) have gained widespread attention, especially in pharmacogenomics but for several genes functional relevance and clinical evidence are still lacking. Detection of CNVs in next-generation sequencing data is challenging but offers widespread applications. We developed a cohort-based CNV detection workflow to extract CNVs from read counts of targeted NGS of 340 genes involved in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of drugs. We applied our method to 150 human liver tissue samples and correlated identified CNVs to mRNA expression levels. In total, we identified 445 deletions (73%) and 167 duplications (27%) in 36 pharmacogenes including all well-known CNVs of CYPs, GSTs, SULTs, UGTs, numerous described rare CNVs of CYP2E1, SLC16A3 or UGT2B15 as well as novel observations, e.g., for SLC22A12, SLC22A17 and GPS2 (G Protein Pathway Suppressor 2). We were able to fine-map complex CNVs of CYP2A6 and CYP2D6 with exon resolution. Correlation analysis confirmed known expression patterns for common CNVs and suggested an influence on expression variability for some rare CNVs. Our straightforward CNV detection workflow can be easily applied to any NGS coverage data and helped to analyze CNVs in an ADME-NGS panel of 340 pharmacogenes to improve genotype–phenotype correlations. Active Force Generation in Cardiac Muscle Cells: Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulation of the Actin-Myosin Interaction AbstractCardiac in silico numerical simulations are based on mathematical models describing the physical processes involved in the heart function. In this review paper, we critically survey biophysically-detailed mathematical models describing the subcellular mechanisms behind the generation of active force, that is the process by which the chemical energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is transformed into mechanical work, thus making the muscle tissue contract. While presenting these models, that feature different levels of biophysical detail, we analyze the trade-off between the accuracy in the description of the subcellular mechanisms and the number of parameters that need to be estimated from experiments. Then, we focus on a generalized version of the classic Huxley model, built on the basis of models available in the literature, that is able to reproduce the main experimental characterizations associated to the time scales typical of a heartbeat—such as the force-velocity relationship and the tissue stiffness in response to small steps—featuring only four independent parameters. Finally, we show how those parameters can be calibrated starting from macroscopic measurements available from experiments. Investigating the mechanical response of paediatric bone under bending and torsion using finite element analysis Fractures of bone account 25% of all paediatric injuries (Cooper et al. in J Bone Miner Res 19:1976-1981, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1359/JBMR.040902 ). These can be broadly categorised into accidental or inflicted injuries. The current clinical approach to distinguish between these two is based on the clinician\\'s judgment, which can be subjective. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on paediatric bone to provide evidence-based information on bone strength, mainly due to the difficulties of obtaining paediatric bone samples. There is a need to investigate the behaviour of children\\'s bones under external loading. Such data will critically enhance our understanding of injury tolerance of paediatric bones under various loading conditions, related to injuries, such as bending and torsional loads. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the response of paediatric femora under two types of loading conditions, bending and torsion, using a CT-based finite element approach, and to determine a relationship between bone strength and age/body mass of the child. Thirty post-mortem CT scans of children aged between 0 and 3\\xa0years old were used in this study. Two different boundary conditions were defined to represent four-point bending and pure torsional loads. The principal strain criterion was used to estimate the failure moment for both loading conditions. The results showed that failure moment of the bone increases with the age and mass of the child. The predicted failure moment for bending, external and internal torsions were 0.8-27.9, 1.0-31.4 and 1.0-30.7\\xa0Nm, respectively. To the authors\\' knowledge, this is the first report on infant bone strength in relation to age/mass using models developed from modern medical images. This technology may in future help advance the design of child, car restrain system, and more accurate computer models of children. A multiscale model to predict current absolute risk of femoral fracture in a postmenopausal population Osteoporotic hip fractures are a major healthcare problem. Fall severity and bone strength are important risk factors of hip fracture. This study aims to obtain a mechanistic explanation for fracture risk in dependence of these risk factors. A novel modelling approach is developed that combines models at different scales to overcome the challenge of a large space–time domain of interest and considers the variability of impact forces between potential falls in a subject. The multiscale model and its component models are verified with respect to numerical approximations made therein, the propagation of measurement uncertainties of model inputs is quantified, and model predictions are validated against experimental and clinical data. The main results are model predicted absolute risk of current fracture (ARF0) that ranged from 1.93 to 81.6% (median 36.1%) for subjects in a retrospective cohort of 98 postmenopausal British women (49 fracture cases and 49 controls); ARF0 was computed up to a precision of 1.92 percentage points (pp) due to numerical approximations made in the model; ARF0 possessed an uncertainty of 4.00\\xa0pp due to uncertainties in measuring model inputs; ARF0 classified observed fracture status in the above cohort with AUC = 0.852 (95% CI 0.753–0.918), 77.6% specificity (95% CI 63.4–86.5%) and 81.6% sensitivity (95% CI 68.3–91.1%). These results demonstrate that ARF0 can be computed using the model with sufficient precision to distinguish between subjects and that the novel mechanism of fracture risk determination based on fall dynamics, hip impact and bone strength can be considered validated. Liquid Chromatography Techniques in Lipidomics Research Lipids represent a very diverse group of compounds with\\xa0a high variety of physicochemical properties determining their functional activities. For omics-wide identification of lipid species from complex biological samples, several crucial analytical steps including extraction, chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry analysis need to be carefully considered and validated. Here we review applications of three main chromatography techniques—reversed phase, normal phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography—for analysis of complex natural lipidomes aiming to uncover the diversity of lipid species. To correlate lipid separation with their physicochemical properties, lipid chemical space was reconstructed and used to explain principles underlying different chromatographic techniques. Furthermore, examples of available methods for analysis of complex natural lipidomes characterized by high diversity and dynamic range of lipid concentrations are illustrated for adipose tissue lipidomics. Real-Time Clustered Multiple Signal Classification (RTC-MUSIC) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) provide a high temporal resolution, which allows estimation of the detailed time courses of neuronal activity. However, in real-time analysis of these data two major challenges must be handled: the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the limited time available for computations. In this work, we present Real-Time Clustered Multiple Signal Classification (RTC-MUSIC) a real-time source localization algorithm, which can handle low SNRs and can reduce the computational effort. It provides correlation information together with sparse source estimation results, which can, e.g., be used to identify evoked responses with high sensitivity. RTC-MUSIC clusters the forward solution based on an anatomical brain atlas and optimizes the scanning process inherent to MUSIC approaches. We evaluated RTC-MUSIC by analyzing MEG auditory and somatosensory data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method localizes sources reliably. For the auditory experiment the most dominant correlated source pair was located bilaterally in the superior temporal gyri. The highest activation in the somatosensory experiment was found in the contra-lateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Future evolution of extreme precipitation in the Mediterranean Mediterranean basins can be impacted by severe floods caused by extreme rainfall, and there is a growing awareness about the possible increase in these heavy rainfall events due to climate change. In this study, the climate change impacts on extreme daily precipitation in 102 catchments covering the whole Mediterranean basin are investigated using nonstationary extreme value model applied to annual maximum precipitation in an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the Euro-CORDEX experiment. Results indicate contrasted trends, with significant increasing trends in Northern catchments and conversely decreasing trends in Southern catchments. For most cases, the time of signal emergence for these trends is before the year 2000. The same spatial pattern is obtained under the two climate scenarios considered (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and in most RCM simulations, suggesting a robust climate change signal. The strongest multi-model agreement concerns the positive trends, which can exceed + 20% by the end of the twenty-first century in some simulations, impacting South France, North Italy, and the Balkans. For these areas, society-relevant strong impacts of such Mediterranean extreme precipitation changes could be expected in particular concerning flood-related damages. Addressing ambiguity in probabilistic assessments of future coastal flooding using possibility distributions Decision-making in the area of coastal adaptation is facing major challenges due to ambiguity (i.e., deep uncertainty) pertaining to the selection of a probability model for sea level rise (SLR) projections. Possibility distributions are mathematical tools that address this type of uncertainty since they bound all the plausible probability models that are consistent with the available data. In the present study, SLR uncertainties are represented by a possibility distribution constrained by likely ranges provided in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and by a review of high-end scenarios. On this basis, we propose a framework combining probabilities and possibilities to evaluate how SLR uncertainties accumulate with other sources of uncertainties, such as future greenhouse gas emissions, upper bounds of future sea level changes, the regional variability of sea level changes, the vertical ground motion, and the contributions of extremes and wave effects. We apply the framework to evaluate the probability of coastal flooding by the year 2100 at a local, low-lying coastal French urban area on the Mediterranean coast. We show that when adaptation is limited to maintaining current defenses, the level of ambiguity is too large to precisely assign a probability model to future flooding. Raising the coastal walls by 85\\xa0cm creates a safety margin that may not be considered sufficient by local stakeholders. A sensitivity analysis highlights the key role of deep uncertainties pertaining to global SLR and of the statistical uncertainty related to extremes. The ranking of uncertainties strongly depends on the decision-maker’s attitude to risk (e.g., neutral, averse), which highlights the need for research combining advanced mathematical theories of uncertainties with decision analytics and social science. Interactions Between Mean Sea Level, Tide, Surge, Waves and Flooding: Mechanisms and Contributions to Sea Level Variations at the Coast International audience; Coastal areas epitomize the notion of `at risk\\' territory in the context of climate change and sea-level rise (SLR). Knowledge of the water level changes at the coast resulting from the mean sea level variability, tide, atmospheric surge and wave setup is critical for coastal flooding assessment. This study investigates how coastal water level can be altered by interactions between SLR, tides, storm surges, waves and flooding. The main mechanisms of interaction are identified, mainly by analyzing the shallow-water equations. Based on a literature review, the orders of magnitude of these interactions are estimated in different environments. The investigated interactions exhibit a strong spatio-temporal variability. Depending on the type of environments (e.g. morphology, hydro-meteorological context), they can reach several tens of centimeters (positive or negative). As a consequence, probabilistic projections of future coastal water levels and flooding should identify whether interaction processes are of leading order, and, where appropriate, projections should account for these interactions through modeling or statistical methods. Extreme Sensitivity and Climate Tipping Points A climate state close to a tipping point will have a degenerate linear response to perturbations, which can be associated with extreme values of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). In this paper we contrast linearized (`instantaneous\\') with fully nonlinear geometric (`two-point\\') notions of ECS, in both presence and absence of tipping points. For a stochastic energy balance model of the global mean surface temperature with two stable regimes, we confirm that tipping events cause the appearance of extremes in both notions of ECS. Moreover, multiple regimes with different mean sensitivities are visible in the two-point ECS. We confirm some of our findings in a physics-based multi-box model of the climate system. Calcineurin is an important factor involved in glucose uptake in human adipocytes Calcineurin inhibitors are used in immunosuppressive therapy applied after transplantation, but they are associated with major metabolic side effects including the development of new onset diabetes. Previously, we have shown that the calcineurin inhibiting drugs tacrolimus and cyclosporin A reduce adipocyte and myocyte glucose uptakes by reducing the amount of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) at the cell surface, due to an increased internalization rate. However, this happens without alteration in total protein and phosphorylation levels of key proteins involved in insulin signalling or in the total amount of GLUT4. The present study evaluates possible pathways involved in the altered internalization of GLUT4 and consequent reduction of glucose uptake provoked by calcineurin inhibitors in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Short- and long-term treatments with tacrolimus, cyclosporin A or another CNI deltamethrin (herbicide) decreased basal and insulin-dependent glucose uptake in adipocytes, without any additive effects observed when added together. However, no tacrolimus effects were observed on glucose uptake when gene transcription and protein translation were inhibited. Investigation of genes potentially involved in GLUT4 trafficking showed only a small effect on ARHGEF11 gene expression (p < 0.05). In conlusion, the specific inhibition of calcineurin, but not that of protein phosphatases, decreases glucose uptake in human subcutaneous adipocytes, suggesting that calcineurin is an important regulator of glucose transport. This inhibitory effect is mediated via gene transcription or protein translation; however, expression of genes potentially involved in GLUT4 trafficking and endocytosis appears not to be involved in these effects. Elevated serum ceramides are linked with obesity-associated gut dysbiosis and impaired glucose metabolism INTRODUCTION: Low gut microbiome richness is associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and ceramides and other sphingolipids are implicated in the development of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether circulating sphingolipids, particularly ceramides, are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome among obese patients with increased diabetes risk. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective analysis of a dietary/weight loss intervention. Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome. RESULTS: Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty acid chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders. Influence of fiber connectivity in simulations of cardiac biomechanics Purpose: Personalized computational simulations of the heart could open up new improved approaches to diagnosis and surgery assistance systems. While it is fully recognized that myocardial fiber orientation is central for the construction of realistic computational models of cardiac electromechanics, the role of its overall architecture and connectivity remains unclear. Morphological studies show that the distribution of cardiac muscular fibers at the basal ring connects epicardium and endocardium. However, computational models simplify their distribution and disregard the basal loop. This work explores the influence in computational simulations of fiber distribution at different short-axis cuts. Methods: We have used a highly parallelized computational solver to test different fiber models of ventricular muscular connectivity. We have considered two rule-based mathematical models and an own-designed method preserving basal connectivity as observed in experimental data. Simulated cardiac functional scores (rotation, torsion and longitudinal shortening) were compared to experimental healthy ranges using generalized models (rotation) and Mahalanobis distances (shortening, torsion). Results: The probability of rotation was significantly lower for ruled-based models [95% CI (0.13, 0.20)] in comparison with experimental data [95% CI (0.23, 0.31)]. The Mahalanobis distance for experimental data was in the edge of the region enclosing 99% of the healthy population. Conclusions: Cardiac electromechanical simulations of the heart with fibers extracted from experimental data produce functional scores closer to healthy ranges than rule-based models disregarding architecture connectivity. Multiple Aneurysms AnaTomy CHallenge 2018 (MATCH)—phase II: rupture risk assessment Purpose Assessing the rupture probability of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remains challenging. Therefore, hemodynamic simulations are increasingly applied toward supporting physicians during treatment planning. However, due to several assumptions, the clinical acceptance of these methods remains limited. Methods To provide an overview of state-of-the-art blood flow simulation capabilities, the Multiple Aneurysms AnaTomy CHallenge 2018 (MATCH) was conducted. Seventeen research groups from all over the world performed segmentations and hemodynamic simulations to identify the ruptured aneurysm in a patient harboring five IAs. Although simulation setups revealed good similarity, clear differences exist with respect to the analysis of aneurysm shape and blood flow results. Most groups (12/71%) included morphological and hemodynamic parameters in their analysis, with aspect ratio and wall shear stress as the most popular candidates, respectively. Results The majority of groups (7/41%) selected the largest aneurysm as being the ruptured one. Four (24%) of the participating groups were able to correctly select the ruptured aneurysm, while three groups (18%) ranked the ruptured aneurysm as the second most probable. Successful selections were based on the integration of clinically relevant information such as the aneurysm site, as well as advanced rupture probability models considering multiple parameters. Additionally, flow characteristics such as the quantification of inflow jets and the identification of multiple vortices led to correct predictions. Conclusions MATCH compares state-of-the-art image-based blood flow simulation approaches to assess the rupture risk of IAs. Furthermore, this challenge highlights the importance of multivariate analyses by combining clinically relevant metadata with advanced morphological and hemodynamic quantification. Are CT-Based Finite Element Model Predictions of Femoral Bone Strengthening Clinically Useful? Purpose of Review: This study reviews the available literature to compare the accuracy of areal bone mineral density derived from dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA-aBMD) and of subject-specific finite element models derived from quantitative computed tomography (QCT-SSFE) in predicting bone strength measured experimentally on cadaver bones, as well as their clinical accuracy both in terms of discrimination and prediction. Based on this information, some basic cost-effectiveness calculations are performed to explore the use of QCT-SSFE instead of DXA-aBMD in (a) clinical studies with femoral strength as endpoint, (b) predictor of the risk of hip fracture in low bone mass patients. Recent Findings: Recent improvements involving the use of smooth-boundary meshes, better anatomical referencing for proximal-only scans, multiple side-fall directions, and refined boundary conditions increase the predictive accuracy of QCT-SSFE. Summary: If these improvements are adopted, QCT-SSFE is always preferable over DXA-aBMD in clinical studies with femoral strength as the endpoint, while it is not yet cost-effective as a hip fracture risk predictor, although pathways that combine both QCT-SSFE and DXA-aBMD are promising. Assessment of right ventricular sympathetic dysfunction in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: An 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine SPECT/CT study Purpose The purpose of the study was to evaluate a novel approach for the quantification of right ventricular sympathetic dysfunction in patients diagnosed with ARVC/D through state-of-the-art functional SPECT/CT hybrid imaging. Methods Sympathetic innervation of the heart was assessed using 123I-MIBG-SPECT/CT in 17 patients diagnosed with ARVC according to the modified task force criteria, and in 10 patients diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). The 123I-MIBG-uptake in the left (LV) and right ventricle (RV) was evaluated separately based on anatomic information derived from the CT scan, and compared to the uptake in the mediastinum (M). Results There was a significant difference in the LV/M ratio between the ARVC/D and the IVF groups (3.2\\u2009±\\u20090.5 vs. 3.9\\u2009±\\u20090.8, P\\u2009=\\u20090.014), with a cut-off value of 3.41 (77% sensitivity, 80% specificity, AUC 0.78). There was a highly significant difference in the mean RV/M ratios between both groups (1.6\\u2009±\\u20090.3 vs. 2.0\\u2009±\\u20090.2, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), with optimal cut-off for discrimination at 1.86 (88% sensitivity, 90% specificity, AUC 0.93). Conclusion Employing state-of-the-art functional SPECT/CT hybrid imaging, we could reliably assess and quantify right and left ventricular sympathetic innervation. The RV/M ratio was significantly lower in patients diagnosed with ARVC/D and provided sensitive and specific discrimination between patients with ARVC/D and IVF patients.

Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation in athletes: what we know and what we do not know Exercise is an emerging cause of atrial fibrillation (AF) in young individuals without coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. The causes of exercise-induced atrial fibrillation remain largely unknown, and conclusions are jeopardised by apparently conflicting data. Some components of the athlete’s heart are known to be arrhythmogenic in other settings. Bradycardia, atrial dilatation and, possibly, atrial premature beats are therefore biologically plausible contributors to exercise-induced AF. Challenging findings in an animal model suggest that exercise might also prompt the development of atrial fibrosis, possibly due to cumulative minor structural damage after each exercise bout. However, there is very limited, indirect data supporting this hypothesis in athletes. Age, sex, the presence of comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors, and genetic individual variability might serve to flag those athletes who are at the higher risk of exercise-induced AF. In this review, we will critically address current knowledge on the mechanisms of exercise-induced AF. Uncertainty Quantification of a Multiscale Model for In-Stent Restenosis Purpose: Coronary artery stenosis, or abnormal narrowing, is a widespread and potentially fatal cardiac disease. After treatment by balloon angioplasty and stenting, restenosis may occur inside the stent due to excessive neointima formation. Simulations of in-stent restenosis can provide new insight into this process. However, uncertainties due to variability in patient-specific parameters must be taken into account. Methods: We performed an uncertainty quantification (UQ) study on a complex two-dimensional in-stent restenosis model. We used a quasi-Monte Carlo method for UQ of the neointimal area, and the Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) to estimate the proportions of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties and to determine the most important input parameters. Results: We observe approximately 30% uncertainty in the mean neointimal area as simulated by the model. Depending on whether a fast initial endothelium recovery occurs, the proportion of the model variance due to natural variability ranges from 15 to 35%. The endothelium regeneration time is identified as the most influential model parameter. Conclusion: The model output contains a moderate quantity of uncertainty, and the model precision can be increased by obtaining a more certain value on the endothelium regeneration time. We conclude that the quasi-Monte Carlo UQ and the Sobol SA are reliable methods for estimating uncertainties in the response of complicated multiscale cardiovascular models. Mapping Unsaturation in Human Plasma Lipids by Data-Independent Ozone-Induced Dissociation Over 1500 different lipids have been reported in human plasma at the sum composition level. Yet the number of unique lipids present is surely higher, once isomeric contributions from double bond location(s) and fatty acyl regiochemistry are considered. In order to resolve this ambiguity, herein, we describe the incorporation of ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) into data-independent shotgun lipidomics workflows on a high-resolution hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap platform. In this configuration, [M\\u2009+\\u2009Na]+ ions generated by electrospray ionization of a plasma lipid extract were transmitted through the quadrupole in 1\\xa0Da segments. Reaction of mass-selected lipid ions with ozone in the octopole collision cell yielded diagnostic ions for each double bond position. The increased ozone concentration in this region significantly improved ozonolysis efficiency compared with prior implementations on linear ion-trap devices. This advancement translates into increased lipidome coverage and improvements in duty cycle for data-independent MS/MS analysis using shotgun workflows. Grouping all precursor ions with a common OzID neutral loss enables straightforward classification of the lipidome by unsaturation position (with respect to the methyl terminus). Two-dimensional maps obtained from this analysis provide a powerful visualization of structurally related lipids and lipid isomer families within plasma. Global profiling of lipid unsaturation in plasma extracts reveals that most unsaturated lipids are present as isomeric mixtures. These new insights provide a unique picture of underlying metabolism that could in the future provide novel indicators of health and disease. Zika virus outbreak in New Caledonia and Guillain-Barré syndrome: a case-control study International audience; Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with neurologic disorders including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In New Caledonia during the ZIKV outbreak (2014-2015), case-control and retrospective studies have been performed to assess the link between ZIKV and GBS. Among the 15 cases included, 33% had evidence of a recent ZIKV infection compared to only 3.3% in the 30 controls involved. All patients were Melanesian, had facial diplegia and similar neurophysiological pattern consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and recovered well. Furthermore, during the peak of ZIKV transmission, we observed a number of GBS cases higher than the calculated upper limit, emphasizing the fact that ZIKV is now a major trigger of GBS. Salivary Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Abstract The search for accessible and cost-effective biomarkers to complement current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers in the accurate detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other common neurodegenerative disorders remains a challenging task. The advances in ultra-sensitive detection methods has highlighted blood biomarkers (e.g. amyloid-β and neurofilament light) as a valuable and realistic tool in a diagnostic or screening process. Saliva, however, is also a rich source of potential biomarkers for disease detection and offers several practical advantages over biofluids that are currently examined for neurodegenerative disorders. However, while this may be true for the general population, challenges in collecting saliva from an elderly population should be seriously considered. In this review, we begin by discussing how saliva is produced and how age-related conditions can modify saliva production and composition. We then focus on the data available which support the concept of salivary amyloid-β, tau species and novel biomarkers in detecting AD and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models for Prediction of Complex CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) Drug–Drug–Gene Interactions: A Modeling Network of Gemfibrozil, Repaglinide, Pioglitazone, Rifampicin, Clarithromycin and Itraconazole Background Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–gene interactions (DGIs) pose a serious health risk that can be avoided by dose adaptation. These interactions are investigated in strictly controlled setups, quantifying the effect of one perpetrator drug or polymorphism at a time, but in real life patients frequently take more than two medications and are very heterogenous regarding their genetic background. Objectives The first objective of this study was to provide whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of important cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 perpetrator and victim drugs, built and evaluated for DDI and DGI studies. The second objective was to apply these models to describe complex interactions with more than two interacting partners. Methods PBPK models of the CYP2C8 and organic-anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 perpetrator drug gemfibrozil (parent–metabolite model) and the CYP2C8 victim drugs repaglinide (also an OATP1B1 substrate) and pioglitazone were developed using a total of 103 clinical studies. For evaluation, these models were applied to predict 34 different DDI studies, establishing a CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 PBPK DDI modeling network. Results The newly developed models show a good performance, accurately describing plasma concentration–time profiles, area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values, DDI studies as well as DGI studies. All 34 of the modeled DDI AUC ratios (AUC during DDI/AUC control) and DDI Cmax ratios (Cmax during DDI/Cmax control) are within twofold of the observed values. Conclusions Whole-body PBPK models of gemfibrozil, repaglinide, and pioglitazone have been built and qualified for DDI and DGI prediction. PBPK modeling is applicable to investigate complex interactions between multiple drugs and genetic polymorphisms.

A mass spectrometry approach for the identification and localization of small aldehyde modifications of proteins Lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids are primary targets of oxidation, which produces reactive short-chain aldehydes that can covalently modify proteins, a process called lipoxidation. Improved mass spectrometry (MS) methods for the analysis of these adducts in complex biological systems are needed. Lysozyme and human serum albumin (HSA) were used as model proteins to investigate lipoxidation products formed by two short-chain aldehydes, acrolein and pentanal, which are unsaturated and saturated aldehydes respectively. The adducts formed were stabilized by NaBH4 or NaBH3CN reduction and analysed by MS. Analysis of intact modified lysozyme showed a pentanal modification resulting from Schiff\\'s base formation (+70 Da), and up to 8 acrolein adducts, all resulting from Michael addition (+58 Da). Analysis of tryptic digests identified specific histidine, cysteine and lysine residues modified in both lysozyme and HSA, and determined characteristic amino acid-specific fragmentations. Eight different internal fragment ions were found that could be used as general diagnostic ions for pentanal- and acrolein-modified amino acids. The combined use of intact protein analysis and LC-MS/MS methods provided a powerful tool for the identification and localization of aldehyde-protein adduct, and the diagnostic ions will facilitate the development of targeted MS methods for analysis of adducts in more complex samples. Substrate selectivity of Dengue and Zika virus NS5 polymerase towards 2′-modified nucleotide analogues International audience; In targeting the essential viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), nucleotide analogues play a major role in antiviral therapies. In the Flaviviridae family, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be eradicated from chronically infected patients using a combination of drugs which generally include the 2\\'-modified uridine analogue Sofosbuvir, delivered as nucleotide prodrug. Dengue and Zika viruses are emerging flaviviruses whose RdRp is closely related to that of HCV, yet no nucleoside drug has been clinically approved for these acute infections. We have purified dengue and Zika virus full-length NS5, the viral RdRps, and used them to assemble a stable binary complex made of NS5 and virus-specific RNA primer/templates. The complex was used to assess the selectivity of NS5 towards nucleotide analogues bearing modifications at the 2\\'-position. We show that dengue and Zika virus RdRps exhibit the same discrimination pattern: 2\\'-O-Me\\xa0>\\xa02\\'-C-Me-2\\'-F\\xa0>\\xa02\\'-C-Me nucleoside analogues, unlike HCV RdRp for which the presence of the 2\\'-F is beneficial rendering the discrimination pattern 2\\'-O-Me\\xa0>\\xa02\\'-C-Me ≥ 2\\'-C-Me-2\\'-F. Both 2\\'-C-Me and 2\\'-C-Me-2\\'-F analogues act as non-obligate RNA chain terminators. The dengue and Zika NS5 nucleotide selectivity towards 2\\'-modified NTPs mirrors potency of the corresponding analogues in infected cell cultures. Evaluation of the BSC-DREAM8b regional dust model using the 3D LIVAS-CALIPSO product Abstract The ability of regional atmospheric models to accurately represent long-range transport of dust is crucial for describing dust effects on radiation and clouds and for reducing their uncertainties on these processes. The optimized CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) pure-dust product that provides the three-dimensional patterns of dust and its transport pathways is a unique tool that can address the aforementioned model\\'s issues. In this study we use the CALIPSO dust extinction profiles as a tool for examining the performance of the regional dust model BSC-DREAM8b in space and time, for the period 2009–2013 over Northern Africa, the Mediterranean, Europe, Eastern North Atlantic and the Middle East. Our analysis suggests that the model overestimates the dust extinction coefficient above dust source regions in Sahara Desert especially at altitudes lower than 3\\u202fkm\\u202fat about 0.04\\u202fkm−1. We also found a slight underestimation of transported dust over Europe and Atlantic Ocean lower than 0.025\\u202fkm−1 of extinction coefficient values all along the vertical column. Over the Mediterranean dust is overestimated (∼0.01\\u202fkm−1) in layers higher than 1\\u202fkm height. Dust in the Middle East is significantly underestimated by the model (∼0.05\\u202fkm−1) all along the vertical column especially during warm seasons. The study also provides an analysis of the CALIPSO limitations and uncertainties on the detection of strong dust activity contributing to the differences between the simulations and observations above the dust sources of Bodele and Algeria. Proteostasis in epicardial versus subcutaneous adipose tissue in heart failure subjects with and without diabetes Abstract Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are leading cause of death and primary cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) covers the heart\\'s surface and is a source of biomolecules regulating heart and blood vessel physiology. The protective activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy allows the cardiomyocyte reticular network to restore energy and/or nutrient homeostasis and to avoid cell death. However, an excessive or prolonged UPR activation can trigger cell death. UPR activation is an early event of diabetic cardiomyopathies and deregulated autophagy is associated with CVDs. Results An upregulation of UPR markers (glucose-regulated protein 78\\u202fKDa, glucose-regulated protein 94\\u202fKDa, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase and CCAAT/−enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) gene) in EAT compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), was observed as well as the UPR-related apoptosis marker caspase-4/procaspase-4 ratio but not in CHOP protein levels. Additionally, levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins were decreased in EAT. Moreover, upregulation of autophagy markers (5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, mechanistic target of rapamycin, Beclin 1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) was observed, as well as an increase in the apoptotic Bim but not the ratio between Bim and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in EAT. Diabetic patients show alterations in UPR activation markers but not in autophagy or apoptosis markers. Conclusion UPR and autophagy are increased in EAT compared to SAT, opening doors to the identification of early biomarkers for cardiomyopathies and novel therapeutic targets. Adipose tissue as a target for second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics: A molecular view Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that chronically affects 21 million people worldwide. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone in the management of schizophrenia. However, despite their efficacy in counteracting both positive and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia, recent clinical observations have described an increase in the prevalence of metabolic disturbances in patients treated with SGAs, including abnormal weight gain, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. While the molecular mechanisms responsible for these side-effects remain poorly understood, increasing evidence points to a link between SGAs and adipose tissue depots of white, brown and beige adipocytes. In this review, we survey the present knowledge in this area, with a particular focus on the molecular aspects of adipocyte biology including differentiation, lipid metabolism, thermogenic function and the browning/beiging process. Specific roles of phosphatidylglycerols in hosts and microbes International audience; Phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) are specific phospholipids bearing negatively charged polar headgroups. Although recognized for long as a major lipid component of membranes in bacteria, it is considered a minor lipid in higher eukaryotes, due to its low abundance in biological fluids or tissues. However, new sensitive lipidomic approaches now provide tools for accurate quantification of PGs in biological samples, and this is likely to uncover new roles for these phospholipids in the near future. This paper reviews our present knowledge in PG function, from studies in microbes and eukaryotic cells, and gathers in one place a diverse range of information spread across many fields. The physical properties of PGs, their biological distribution and molecular functions make them potential actors in host-microbe interaction. Single-Molecule Observation of Ligand Binding and Conformational Changes in FeuA ABSTRACTThe specific binding of ligands by proteins and the coupling of this process to conformational changes are fundamental to protein function. We designed a fluorescence-based single-molecule assay and data analysis procedure that allows the simultaneous real-time observation of ligand binding and conformational changes in FeuA. The substrate-binding protein FeuA binds the ligand ferri-bacillibactin and delivers it to the ABC importer FeuBC, which is involved in iron uptake in bacteria. The conformational dynamics of FeuA was assessed via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whereas the presence of the ligand was probed by fluorophore quenching. We reveal that ligand binding shifts the conformational equilibrium of FeuA from an open to a closed conformation. Ligand binding occurs via an induced-fit mechanism, i.e., the ligand binds to the open state and subsequently triggers a rapid closing of the protein. However, FeuA also rarely samples the closed conformation without the involvement of the ligand. This shows that ligand interactions are not required for conformational changes in FeuA. However, ligand interactions accelerate the conformational change 10000-fold and temporally stabilize the formed conformation 250-fold.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLigand binding and the coupling of this process to conformational changes in proteins are fundamental to their function. We developed a single-molecule approach that allows the simultaneous observation of ligand binding and conformational changes in the substrate-binding protein FeuA. This allows to directly observe the ligand binding process, ligand-driven conformational changes as well as rare short-lived conformational transitions that are uncoupled from the ligand. These findings provide insight into the fundamental relation between ligand-protein interactions and conformational changes. Our findings are, however, not only of interest to understand protein function, but the developed data analysis procedure allows the determination of (relative) distance changes in single-molecule FRET experiments, for situations in which donor and acceptor fluorophore are influenced by quenching processes. Systematic study of the correlation between surface chemistry, conductivity and electrocatalytic properties of graphene oxide nanosheets Abstract A main advantage of graphene oxide (GO) over other materials is the high tunability of its surface functional groups and of its electric conductivity. However, the complex chemical composition of GO renders difficult to unravel the correlation between structural and electric properties. Here, we use a combination of electron spectroscopy and electrochemistry to correlate the surface chemistry of GO to its electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic properties with respect to two molecules of high biological interest: β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and vitamin C. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic properties of the material are due to hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups residues that, even if already present on pristine GO, become electroactive only upon GO reduction. The results of this study demonstrate the advantages in the use of GO in amperometric biosensing and in enzymatic biofuel cells: it allows the oxidation of the target molecules at low potential values, with a sensitivity >15 times higher with respect to standard, carbon-based electrode materials. Finally, we demonstrate that the right amount of chemical groups to achieve such high performance can be obtained also by direct electrochemical exfoliation of bulk graphite, without passing through GO production, thus rendering this approach suitable for cheap, large-scale applications. Accurate chemical analysis of oxygenated graphene-based materials using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Abstract A simple, fast and general protocol for quantitative analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data provides accurate estimations of chemical species in graphene and related materials (GRMs). XPS data are commonly used to estimate the quality of and defects in graphene and graphene oxide (GO), by comparing carbon and oxygen 1s XPS peaks, obtaining an O/C ratio. This approach, however, cannot be used in the presence of extraneous oxygen contamination. The protocol, based on quantitative line-shape analysis of C 1s signals, uses asymmetric pseudo-Voigt line-shapes (APV), in contrast to Gaussian-based approaches conventionally used in fitting XPS spectra, thus allowing better accuracy in quantifying C 1s contributions from graphitic carbon (sp2), defects (sp3 carbon), carbons bonded to hydroxyl and epoxy groups, and from carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The APV protocol was evaluated on GRMs with O/C ratios ranging from 0.02 to 0.30 with film thicknesses from monolayers to bulk-like (>30\\u202fnm) layers and also applied to previously published data, showing better results compared to those from conventional XPS fitting protocols. Based uniquely on C 1s data, the APV protocol can quantify O/C ratio and the presence of specific functional groups in GRMs even on SiOx, substrates, or in samples containing water. Ezh2 and Runx1 Mutations Collaborate to Initiate Lympho-Myeloid Leukemia in Early Thymic Progenitors Lympho-myeloid restricted early thymic progenitors (ETPs) are postulated to be the cell of origin for ETP leukemias, a therapy-resistant leukemia associated with frequent co-occurrence of EZH2 and RUNX1 inactivating mutations, and constitutively activating signaling pathway mutations. In a mouse model, we demonstrate that Ezh2 and Runx1 inactivation targeted to early lymphoid progenitors causes a marked expansion of\\xa0pre-leukemic ETPs, showing transcriptional signatures characteristic of ETP leukemia. Addition of a RAS-signaling\\xa0pathway mutation (Flt3-ITD) results in an aggressive leukemia co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, which can be established and propagated in\\xa0vivo by the expanded ETPs. Both mouse and human ETP leukemias show sensitivity to BET inhibition in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo, which reverses aberrant gene expression induced by Ezh2 inactivation. Strategies for in vivo reprogramming Reprogramming has the potential to provide specific cell types for regenerative medicine applications aiming at replacing tissues that have been lost or damaged due to degenerative diseases and injury. In this review we discuss the latest strategies and advances of in vivo reprogramming to convert cell identities in living organisms, including reprogramming induced by transcription factors (TFs) and CRISPR/dCas9 synthetic TFs, as well as by cell fusion and small molecules. We also provide a brief recap of reprogramming barriers, the effect of senescence on reprogramming efficiency, and strategies to deliver reprogramming factors in vivo. Because of the limited space, we omit dwelling on naturally occurring reprogramming phenomena such as developmentally programmed transdifferentiation found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Graphene oxide doped polysulfone membrane adsorbers for the removal of organic contaminants from water Abstract This work explored polysulfone (PS) – graphene oxide (GO) based porous membranes (PS-GO) as adsorber of seven selected organic contaminants of emerging concern (EOCs) including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, a dye and a surfactant from water. PS-GO was prepared by phase inversion method starting from a PS and GO mixture (5% w/w of GO). The porous PS-GO membranes showed asymmetric and highly porous micrometer sized pores on membrane top (diameter ≈20\\xa0μm) and bottom (diameter ≈2–5\\xa0μm) surfaces and tens of microns length finger like pores in the section. Nanomechanical mapping reveals patches of a stiffer material with Young modules comprised in the range 15–25\\xa0GPa, not present in PS pure membranes that are compatible with the presence of GO flakes on the membrane surfaces. PS-GO was immersed in EOCs spiked tap water and the adsorbance efficiency at different contact times and pH evaluated by HPLC analysis. Ofloxacin (OFLOX), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), rhodamine b (Rh), diclofenac (DCF) and triton X-100 (TRX) were removed with efficiency higher than 90% after 4\\xa0h treatments. Regeneration of PS-GO and reuse possibilities were demonstrated by washing with ethanol. The adsorption efficiencies toward OFLOX, Rh, DCF and carbamazepine (CBZ) were significantly higher than those of pure PS membrane. Moreover, PS-GO outperformed a commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) at low contact times and compared well at longer contact time for OFLOX, Rh, BP-3 and TRX suggesting the suitability of the newly introduced material for drinking water treatment. Pharmacogenomics of GPCR Drug Targets Summary Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a cause of individual differences in responses to medications and is an underappreciated burden on public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of μ-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, improving patients’ quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal burden due to variable drug responsiveness. Video Abstract Drug-Driven Phenotypic Convergence Supports Rational Treatment Strategies of Chronic Infections Summary Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections evade antibiotic therapy and are associated with mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We find that in\\xa0vitro resistance evolution of P.\\xa0aeruginosa toward clinically relevant antibiotics leads to phenotypic convergence toward distinct states. These states are associated with collateral sensitivity toward several antibiotic classes and encoded by mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, including transcriptional regulator nfxB. Longitudinal analysis of isolates from CF patients reveals similar and defined phenotypic states, which are associated with extinction of specific sub-lineages in patients. In-depth investigation of chronic P.\\xa0aeruginosa populations in a CF patient during antibiotic therapy revealed dramatic genotypic and phenotypic convergence. Notably, fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulations harboring nfxB mutations were eradicated by antibiotic therapy as predicted by our in\\xa0vitro data. This study supports the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment of chronic infections can be optimized by targeting phenotypic states associated with specific mutations to improve treatment success in chronic infections. Low-Frequency and Rare-Coding Variation Contributes to Multiple Sclerosis Risk Summary Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurological disease,\\xa0with ∼20% of risk heritability attributable to common\\xa0genetic variants, including >230 identified\\xa0by genome-wide association studies. Multiple strands of evidence suggest that much of the remaining heritability is also due to additive effects of common variants rather than epistasis between these variants or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that up to 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of\\xa0common-variant signals, highlighting key pathogenic roles for regulatory T\\xa0cell homeostasis and regulation, IFNγ biology, and NFκB signaling. As low-frequency variants do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than non-coding variation, our discoveries constitute a rich resource for dissecting the pathobiology of MS. Oxidized phosphatidylserine mitigates LPS-triggered macrophage inflammatory status through modulation of JNK and NF-kB signaling cascades Abstract Recent evidence suggests that phosphatidylserine (PS) and its oxidized species drive the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages with putative immune response modulation. However, it is not clear whether PS and oxidized PS differentially modulate at molecular level the functional responses of macrophages. Therefore, we proposed in this work to explore this question by evaluating the influence of PS oxidation products on the macrophages inflammatory status. Thus, we determined the effects of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylserine (oxPLPS) and PLPS on RAW 264.7 macrophages production of the pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) and on the levels of the inducible NO synthase (Nos2) and Il1β mRNA. The ability of PLPS and oxPLPS to modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered macrophage activation was also analyzed. Finally, the effects of PLPS species over canonical inflammation-associated signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were also disclosed. The results obtained showed that both PLPS and oxPLPS species are deprived of intrinsic pro-inflammatory activity. Exquisitely, only oxPS were found to significantly inhibit NO production and iNos and IL1β genes transcription induced by LPS. At a molecular level, these effects were partially due to attenuation of LPS-induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation. Overall our data suggest that oxPLPS, but not native PLPS, mitigates pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages, contributing to containment of inflammation during apoptotic cell engulfment. A CRISPR Dropout Screen Identifies Genetic Vulnerabilities and Therapeutic Targets in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study. KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies. Genetic Architecture of Adaptive Immune System Identifies Key Immune Regulators Summary The immune system is highly diverse, but characterization of its genetic architecture has lagged behind the vast progress made by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of emergent diseases. Our GWAS for 54 functionally relevant phenotypes of the adaptive immune system in 489 healthy individuals identifies eight genome-wide significant associations explaining 6%–20% of variance. Coding and splicing variants in PTPRC and COMMD10 are involved in memory T\\xa0cell differentiation. Genetic variation controlling disease-relevant T helper cell subsets includes RICTOR and STON2 associated with Th2 and Th17, respectively, and the interferon-lambda locus controlling regulatory T\\xa0cell proliferation. Early and memory B cell differentiation stages are associated with variation in LARP1B and SP4. Finally, the latrophilin family member ADGRL2 correlates with baseline pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 levels. Suggestive associations reveal mechanisms of autoimmune disease associations, in particular related to pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Pinpointing these key human immune regulators offers attractive therapeutic perspectives. ABCE1 Controls Ribosome Recycling by an Asymmetric Dynamic Conformational Equilibrium Summary The twin-ATPase ABCE1 has a vital function in mRNA translation by recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes. As for other functionally distinct ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, the mechanochemical coupling of ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes remains elusive. Here, we use an integrated biophysical approach allowing direct observation of conformational dynamics and ribosome association of ABCE1 at the single-molecule level. Our results from FRET experiments show that the current static two-state model of ABC proteins has to be expanded because the two ATP sites of ABCE1 are in dynamic equilibrium across three distinct conformational states: open, intermediate, and closed. The interaction of ABCE1 with ribosomes influences the conformational dynamics of both ATP sites asymmetrically and creates a complex network of conformational states. Our findings suggest a paradigm shift to redefine the understanding of the mechanochemical coupling in ABC proteins: from structure-based deterministic models to dynamic-based systems. Noninvasive Detection of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Using\\xa0Clinical Markers and Circulating Levels of Lipids and\\xa0Metabolites Background & Aims\\\\ud \\\\ud Use of targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods is increasing in clinical chemistry laboratories. We investigate whether MS-based profiling of plasma improves noninvasive risk estimates of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared with routinely available clinical parameters and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) genotype at rs738409.\\\\ud \\\\ud Methods\\\\ud \\\\ud We used MS-based analytic platforms to measure levels of lipids and metabolites in blood samples from 318 subjects who underwent a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. The subjects were divided randomly into estimation (n = 223) and validation (n = 95) groups to build and validate the model. Gibbs sampling and stepwise logistic regression, which fulfilled the Bayesian information criterion, were used for variable selection and modeling.\\\\ud \\\\ud Results\\\\ud \\\\ud Features of the metabolic syndrome and the variant in PNPLA3 encoding I148M were significantly more common among subjects with than without NASH. We developed a model to identify subjects with NASH based on clinical data and PNPLA3 genotype (NASH Clin Score), which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype. This model identified subjects with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.792 (95% confidence interval, 0.726–0.859). We then used backward stepwise logistic regression analyses of variables from the NASH Clin Score and MS-based factors associated with NASH to develop the NASH ClinLipMet Score. This included glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6, AST, and fasting insulin, along with PNPLA3 genotype. It identified patients with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.866 (95% confidence interval, 0.820–0.913). The NASH ClinLipMet score identified patients with NASH with significantly higher accuracy than the NASH Clin Score or MS-based profiling alone.\\\\ud \\\\ud Conclusions\\\\ud \\\\ud A score based on MS (glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6) and knowledge of AST, fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype is significantly better than a score based on clinical or metabolic profiles alone in determining the risk of NASH. Health-related Quality of Life in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Associates With Hepatic Inflammation Background & Aims Chronic liver disease has negative effects on health-related quality of life (HRQL). We analyzed data from the European non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) registry to assess the effects of NAFLD on HRQL. Methods We collected data from 304 patients (mean age, 52.3 ± 12.9 years) with histologically defined NAFLD enrolled prospectively into the European NAFLD Registry in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) was completed within 6 months of liver biopsy collection. Results The mean CLDQ overall score was 5.0 ± 1.2, with the lowest score in the category fatigue (4.3 ± 1.6) and the highest scores for activity (5.4 ± 1.4). Women had significantly lower CLDQ scores than men (4.6 ± 1.3 vs 5.3 ± 1.1; P Conclusion In an analysis of data from the European NAFLD registry, we observed a substantial burden of symptoms in patients. In addition to age, sex, and the presence of diabetes, detection of lobular inflammation in biopsies correlated with lower HRQL. Rational selection of reverse phase columns for high throughput LC–MS lipidomics Abstract Natural lipidomes are characterized by extremely high complexity and dynamic range of lipid concentrations. Furthermore, high diversity of lipid physicochemical properties requires high resolving powers for both chromatographic and mass spectrometric analytical platforms. Reverse-phase chromatography coupled with data-dependent MS/MS acquisition is one of the most popular techniques in untargeted lipidomics. Optimal method should provide good chromatographic separation and resolution, reproducibility, selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we developed and set-up a RPLC-MS/MS workflow capable of resolving complex mixtures of lipids in 32\\u2009min of analysis. Human blood plasma was chosen as a representative complex natural lipidome with large variance of lipid classes, species and lipid concentrations. Lipids were separated by RPLC on five different reverse phase columns with different types of stationary phase particles, size and chemistry. High mass accuracy MS analysis and data-dependent MS/MS analysis were performed using a Q Exactive™ HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer to identify individual lipid molecular species. This workflow was applied to evaluate the separation capability of each column and to identify the lipidomics profile in highly complex biological samples. As a result, we report more than 600 lipid species covering 18 lipid classes in human blood plasma and provide suggestions to the selection of the appropriate reverse phase column for the analysis of specific lipidomes. A comparison of collision cross section values obtained via travelling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry and ultra high performance liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry: Application to the characterisation of metabolites in rat urine A comprehensive Collision Cross Section (CCS) library was obtained via Travelling Wave Ion Guide mobility measurements through direct infusion (DI). The library consists of CCS and Mass Spectral (MS) data in negative and positive ElectroSpray Ionisation (ESI) mode for 463 and 479 endogenous metabolites, respectively. For both ionisation modes combined, TWCCSN2 data were obtained for 542 non-redundant metabolites. These data were acquired on two different ion mobility enabled orthogonal acceleration QToF MS systems in two different laboratories, with the majority of the resulting TWCCSN2 values (from detected compounds) found to be within 1% of one another. Validation of these results against two independent, external TWCCSN2 data sources and predicted TWCCSN2 values indicated to be within 1–2% of these other values. The same metabolites were then analysed using a rapid reversed-phase ultra (high) performance liquid chromatographic (U(H)PLC) separation combined with IM and MS (IM-MS) thus providing retention time (tr), m/z and TWCCSN2 values (with the latter compared with the DI-IM-MS data). Analytes for which TWCCSN2 values were obtained by U(H)PLC-IM-MS showed good agreement with the results obtained from DI-IM-MS. The repeatability of the TWCCSN2 values obtained for these metabolites on the different ion mobility QToF systems, using either DI or LC, encouraged the further evaluation of the U(H)PLC-IM-MS approach via the analysis of samples of rat urine, from control and methotrexate-treated animals, in order to assess the potential of the approach for metabolite identification and profiling in metabolic phenotyping studies. Based on the database derived from the standards 63 metabolites were identified in rat urine, using positive ESI, based on the combination of tr, TWCCSN2 and MS data. The effect of boundary and loading conditions on patient classification using finite element predicted risk of fracture Background:\\\\ud \\\\ud Osteoporotic proximal femoral fractures associated to falls are a major health burden in the ageing society. Recently, bone strength estimated by finite element models emerged as a feasible alternative to areal bone mineral density as a predictor of fracture risk. However, previous studies showed that the accuracy of patients\\' classification under their risk of fracture using finite element strength when simulating posterolateral falls is only marginally better than that of areal bone mineral density. Patients tend to fall in various directions: since the predicted strength is sensitive to the fall direction, a prediction based on certain fall directions might not be fully representative of the physical event. Hence, side fall boundary conditions may not be completely representing the physical event.\\\\ud \\\\ud Methods:\\\\ud \\\\ud The effect of different side fall boundary and loading conditions on a retrospective cohort of 98 postmenopausal women was evaluated to test models\\' ability to discriminate fracture and control cases. Three different boundary conditions (Linear, Multi-point constraints and Contact model) were investigated under various anterolateral and posterolateral falls.\\\\ud \\\\ud Findings:\\\\ud \\\\ud The stratification power estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for Contact model (0.82), followed by Multi-point constraints and Linear models with 0.80. Both Contact and MPC models predicted high strains in various locations of the proximal femur including the greater trochanter, which has rarely reported previously.\\\\ud \\\\ud Interpretation:\\\\ud \\\\ud A full range of fall directions and less restrictive displacement constraints can improve the finite element strength ability to classify patients under their risk of fracture. Influence of CYP450 Enzymes, CES1, PON1, ABCB1, and P2RY12 Polymorphisms on Clopidogrel Response in Patients Subjected to a Percutaneous Neurointervention [Findings]: We confirmed that CYP2C19 is the most important enzyme involved in clopidogrel response. The carriage of the CYP2C19*2 allele was strongly associated with hyporesponse to clopidogrel, while the CYP2C19*17 allele was a protective factor for the development of ischemic events (odds ratio = 0.149; P = 0.002) but a risk factor for bleeding (odds ratio = 3.60; P = 0.038). Patients carrying ABCB1 mutated alleles showed lower aggregation values, suggesting that clopidogrel absorption is influenced by P-glycoprotein. In fact, the percentage of responders was significantly higher in the group carrying the mutated haplotype compared to the wild type (80.8% vs 43.3%; P = 0.009). Patients with the CES1 G143E C/T genotype showed a considerably lower, aggregation value versus wild-type patients, although the difference was not significant likely due to the small sample size (59.0 [21.2] vs 165.2 [86.0] PRU; P = 0.084), which suggests an increased active metabolite formation. No relationship was found between polymorphisms in other CYP genes, PON1, or P2RY12 and response to clopidogrel in patients subjected to neurointervention procedures. A comparison of hydrological climate services at different scales by users and scientists Given the current proliferation of climate change services, how should a user judge which one is most relevant for a specific case? In this study, climate researchers and users compare continental, national and locally tailored climate change services for two case studies in Sweden with clear adaptation needs. The case studies addressed the organising committee of the large ski-racing event, Vasaloppet, for which snow availability is a concern now and in the future, and a small municipality in Sweden (Karlstad) that is prone to flooding. After meetings and online discussions with users, researchers locally tailored a service by reanalysing the data behind the national climate service. We then compared these locally tailored results with available, comparable data from the pan-European and national climate services, including the projected changes and the uncertainties provided by each service. We found that different climate change services provided different indicators, and magnitudes and directions of climate change. Differences across services are unavoidable, and limitations of climate change services are a reality of the nature of projecting an ultimately uncertain future. Therefore, we call for clearer, more explicit communication of what a climate change service provides, and detailed explanations of the limitations of climate services regarding variables, locations, scales, as well as other uncertainties. We also find that value can be added to existing climate change services by tailoring climate service outputs for a specific location or specific user requirements.

This poses significant challenges to reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques –such as the reduced basis method –traditionally employed when dealing with the repeated solution of parameter dependent differential equations. Indeed, the nonlinear nature of the problem, the presence of moving fronts in the solution, and the high sensitivity of this latter to parameter variations, make the application of standard ROM techniques very problematic. In this paper we propose a local ROM built through a k -means clustering in the state space of the snapshots for both the solution and the nonlinear term. Several comparisons among alternative local ROMs on a benchmark test case show the effectivity of the proposed approach. Finally, the application to a parametrized problem set on an idealized left-ventricle geometry shows the capability of the proposed ROM to face complex problems. Machine learning of multiscale active force generation models for the efficient simulation of cardiac electromechanics High fidelity (HF) mathematical models describing the generation of active force in the cardiac muscle tissue typically feature a large number of state variables to capture the intrinsically complex underlying subcellular mechanisms. With the aim of drastically reducing the computational burden associated with the numerical solution of these models, we propose a machine learning method that builds a reduced order model (ROM); this is obtained as the best-approximation of the HF model within a class of candidate differential equations based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Within a semiphysical (gray-box) approach, an ANN learns the dynamics of the HF model from input-output pairs generated by the HF model itself (i.e. non-intrusively), being additionally informed with some a priori knowledge about the HF model. The ANN-based ROM, with just two internal variables, can accurately reproduce the results of the HF model, that instead features more than 2000 variables, under several physiological and pathological working regimes of the cell. We then propose a multiscale 3D cardiac electromechanical model, wherein active force generation is described by means of the previously trained ANN. We achieve a very favorable balance between accuracy of the result (order of 10(-3) for the main cardiac biomarkers) and computational efficiency (with a speedup of about one order of magnitude), still relying on a biophysically detailed description of the microscopic force generation phenomenon.

Exact solutions to the fractional time-space Bloch–Torrey equation for magnetic resonance imaging Abstract The quantification of anomalous diffusion is increasingly being recognised as an advanced modality of analysis for the evaluation of tissue microstructure in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One powerful framework to account for anomalous diffusion in biological and structurally heterogeneous tissues is the use of diffusion operators based on fractional calculus theory, which generalises the physical principles of standard diffusion in homogeneous media. However, their non-locality makes analytical solutions often unavailable, limiting the applicability of these modelling and analysis techniques. In this paper, we derive compact analytical signal decays for practical MRI sequences in the anisotropic fractional Bloch–Torrey setting, as described by the space fractional Laplacian and importantly the time Caputo derivative. The attained solutions convey relevant characteristics of MRI in biological tissues not replicated by standard diffusion, including super-diffusive and sub-diffusive regimes in signal decay and the diffusion-driven incomplete refocusing of spins at the end of the sequence. These results may therefore have significant implications for advancing the current interpretation of MRI, and for the estimation of tissue properties based on exact solutions to underlying diffusive processes. The gut microbiota — brain axis of insects Research on the connections between gut microbes and the neurophysiology and behavior of their animal hosts has grown exponentially in just a few years. Most studies have focused on mammalian models as their relevance to human health is widely established. However, evidence is accumulating that insect behavior may be governed by molecular mechanisms that are partly homologous to those of mammals, and therefore relevant for the understanding of their behavioral dysfunctions. Social insects in particular may provide experimentally amenable models to disentangle the contributions of individual bacterial symbionts to the gut microbiota — brain axis. In this review, we summarize findings from recent research on the neurological and behavioral effects of the gut microbiota of insects and propose an integrated approach to unravel the extended behavioral phenotypes of gut microbes in the honey bee.

Transdifferentiation: do transition states lie on the path of development? The direct conversion of one differentiated cell fate into another identity is a process known as Transdifferentiation. During Transdifferentiation, cells pass through intermediate states that are not well understood. Given the potential application of transdifferentiation in regenerative medicine and disease modeling, a better understanding of intermediate states is crucial to avoid uncontrolled conversion or proliferation, which pose a risk for patients. Researchers have begun to analyze the transcriptomes of donor, converting and target cells of Transdifferentiation with single cell resolution to compare transitional states to those found along the path of development. Here, we review examples of Transdifferentiation in a range of model systems and organisms. We propose that cells pass either through a mixed, unspecific intermediate or progenitor-like state during Transdifferentiation, which, to varying degrees, resemble states seen during development. The application of the screen-model based approach for stents in cerebral aneurysms Abstract Numerical modeling of the blood flow through flow diverters in intracranial aneurysms is a crucial tool to personalize and optimize endovascular stenting procedures in the treatment of aneurysms. However, large computational meshes are needed to resolve the difference of scale between the struts of a flow diverter and the blood vessel leads, leading to a high computational cost. This article presents a screen-model based approach, a heuristic continuum method which can effectively reduce the computation time by avoiding to fully resolve the stent. We study the performance of the screen-model based stent model under various conditions, such as different stent placements inside an artery, varying homogeneous porosities, and pulsatile inlet velocities. The results show that the stent model can effectively prevent the blood from flowing into the aneurysm as a fully resolved stent does, but at a coarser resolution. The application range of the stent model is tested, and the validity of the model is assessed. Inflow and outflow boundary conditions for 2D suspension simulations with the immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann method Abstract In- and outflow boundary conditions for 2D immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann suspension simulations, applied to cell based blood flow models, are presented. The inlet is constructed with an one-way coupling to a periodic domain containing a correct distribution of suspended particles. This provides an inflow of particles that has a correct distribution and is decoupled from any phenomena in the flow domain. An outflow boundary for the particles that does not influence the distribution of particles in the flow domain is also constructed. With this a method to run long (\\u202f>\\u202f1\\xa0s) cell based blood flow simulations within any type of domain is provided. These boundary conditions are then used for a simulation of blood flow in a curved vessel with an aneurysm. An update on fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases: recent success and challenges ahead Over the last twenty years, the characterization of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) patients has progressed from a description of clinical symptomatology followed by neuropathological findings at autopsy to in vivo pathophysiological signatures using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Additionally, CSF biomarkers now reflect synaptic pathology, axonal injury and neuroinflammation. Novel techniques are capable of measuring proteins of pathophysiological importance at femtomolar concentrations in blood (e.g. amyloid, tau species and neurofilaments), which enable screening of large populations in the near future. This will be essential for secondary prevention trials and clinical management. However, common diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson\\'s disease and frontotemporal dementias, are still without reliable diagnostic biomarkers, although emerging techniques show promising pilot results for some of these diseases. This is likely to change in the next few years, which will be crucial to stratify populations enrolling in clinical trials, since pathologies often coexist. Optimizing the fluorescent protein toolbox and its use Fluorescent proteins (FPs) and fluorescent protein-derived biosensors are indispensable tools in life sciences. They make it possible to probe the location, activity, or interaction of molecules of interest from a subcellular to a multicellular scale. The desire for high-resolution and multidimensional information imposes continuously increasing demands on the performance of the employed probes leading to a continued need for optimization and integration of additional features, such as phototransformable behavior. This review highlights the latest advances in FP engineering, which increase throughput and tailor the improvements directly to the envisioned experiments. Additionally, we discuss recent alternative approaches to introduce or alter phototransformable behavior and describe selected applications of phototransformable behavior in biosensors. ispartof: CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY vol:58 pages:183-191 ispartof: location:England status: published MicroRNAs as a diagnostic tool for heart failure and atrial fibrillation MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which are directly involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression. Their biological function represents a repression of protein expression of the targeted messenger-RNA(s). Expression of several miRNAs is somehow tissue-specific or cell-specific and their expression pattern can reflect an underlying pathophysiological condition. Beyond this biological function their role as potential biomarkers has been emerged in the past years. This was based on the fact that miRNAs can be detected in blood samples (serum or plasma) in a surprisingly stable form, by contrast to mRNAs. This fact made miRNAs interesting candidates for biomarkers providing information with respect to a potentially ongoing pathophysiological condition and could thereby have an impact on specific treatment strategies in patients. In this review we try to provide an overview of the potential role of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool in atrial fibrillation and heart failure patients taken different methodological aspects and distinct type of patients into account. Integrating structural and mutagenesis data to elucidate GPCR ligand binding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of human membrane proteins, as well as drug targets. A recent boom in GPCR structural biology has provided detailed images of receptor ligand binding sites and interactions on the molecular level. An ever-increasing number of ligands is reported that exhibit activity through multiple receptors, binding in allosteric sites, and bias towards different intracellular signalling pathways. Furthermore, a wealth of single point mutants has accumulated in literature and public databases. Integrating these structural and mutagenesis data will help elucidate new GPCR ligand binding sites, and ultimately design drugs with tailored pharmacological activity. Immunomonitoring of human responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is currently the only Ebola vaccine with demonstrated clinical efficacy in a ring-vaccination clinical trial. It has been shown to be reactogenic but immunogenic and safe in several Phase I clinical studies. However, its mechanisms of protection are unknown and available immunogenicity data are mostly limited to classical serological analysis; it is now of paramount importance to apply cutting-edge technologies, including transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, and to perform integrative analyses with standard serology and clinical data to comprehensively profile the rVSV-ZEBOV immune signature. APC/C Cdh1 Enables Removal of Shugoshin-2 from the Arms of Bivalent Chromosomes by Moderating Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Activity Summary In mammalian females, germ cells remain arrested as\\xa0primordial follicles. Resumption of meiosis is heralded by germinal vesicle breakdown, condensation of chromosomes, and their eventual alignment on metaphase plates. At the first meiotic division, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome associated with Cdc20 (APC/CCdc20) activates separase and thereby destroys cohesion along chromosome arms. Because cohesion around centromeres is protected by shugoshin-2, sister chromatids remain attached through centromeric/pericentromeric cohesin. We show here that, by promoting proteolysis of cyclins and Cdc25B at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, APC/C associated with the Cdh1 protein (APC/CCdh1) delays the increase in Cdk1 activity, leading to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). More surprisingly, by moderating the rate at which Cdk1 is activated following GVBD, APC/CCdh1 creates conditions necessary for the removal of shugoshin-2 from chromosome arms by the Aurora B/C kinase, an event crucial for the efficient resolution of chiasmata. SMC1α Substitutes for Many Meiotic Functions of SMC1β but Cannot Protect Telomeres from Damage Summary The cohesin complex is built upon the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, and mammalian meiocytes feature two variants of SMC1 named SMC1α and SMC1β. It is unclear why these two SMC1 variants have evolved. To determine unique versus redundant functions of SMC1β, we asked which of the known functions of SMC1β can be fulfilled by SMC1α. Smc1α was expressed under control of the Smc1β promoter in either wild-type or SMC1β-deficient mice. No effect was seen in the former. However, several major phenotypes of SMC1β-deficient spermatocytes were rescued by SMC1α. We observed extended development before apoptosis and restoration of axial element and synaptonemal complex lengths, chromosome synapsis, sex body formation, processing of DNA double-strand breaks, and formation of MLH1 recombination foci. This supports the concept that the quantity rather than the specific quality of cohesin complexes is decisive for meiotic chromosome architecture. It also suggests plasticity in complex composition, because to replace SMC1β in many functions, SMC1α has to more extensively associate with other cohesins. The cells did not complete meiosis but died to the latest at the pachytene-to-diplotene transition. Telomere aberrations known from Smc1β−/− mice persisted, and DNA damage response and repair proteins accumulated there regardless of expression of SMC1α. Thus, whereas SMC1α can substitute for SMC1β in many functions, the protection of telomere integrity requires SMC1β. Vast Differences in Strain-Level Diversity in the Gut Microbiota of Two Closely Related Honey Bee Species Summary Most bacterial species encompass strains with vastly different gene content. Strain diversity in microbial communities is therefore considered to be of functional importance. Yet little is known about the extent to which related microbial communities differ in diversity at this level and which underlying mechanisms may constrain and maintain strain-level diversity. Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to characterize and compare the gut microbiota of two honey bee species, Apis mellifera and Apis cerana, which diverged about 6 mya. Although the host species are colonized largely by the same bacterial 16S rRNA phylotypes, we find that their communities are host specific when analyzed with genomic resolution. Moreover, despite their similar ecology, A.\\xa0mellifera displayed a much higher diversity of strains and functional gene content in the microbiota compared to A.\\xa0cerana, both per colony and per individual bee. In particular, the gene repertoire for polysaccharide degradation was massively expanded in the microbiota of A.\\xa0mellifera relative to A.\\xa0cerana. Bee management practices, divergent ecological adaptation, or habitat size may have contributed to the observed differences in microbiota genomic diversity of these key pollinator species. Our results illustrate that the gut microbiota of closely related animal hosts can differ vastly in genomic diversity while displaying similar levels of diversity based on the 16S rRNA gene. Such differences are likely to have consequences for gut microbiota functioning and host-symbiont interactions, highlighting the need for metagenomic studies to understand the ecology and evolution of microbial communities. Update on ultrasensitive technologies to facilitate research on blood biomarkers for central nervous system disorders Abstract Most research on fluid biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders has so far been performed using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as the biomarker source. CSF has the advantage of being closer to the brain than serum or plasma with a relative enrichment of CNS‐specific proteins that are present at very low concentrations in the blood and thus difficult to reliably quantify using standard immunochemical technologies. Recent technical breakthroughs in the field of ultrasensitive assays have started to change this. Here, we review the most established ultrasensitive quantitative technologies that are currently available to general biomarker laboratories and discuss their use in research on biomarkers for CNS disorders. FACT Sets a Barrier for Cell Fate Reprogramming in Caenorhabditis elegans and Human Cells The chromatin regulator FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is essential for ensuring stable gene expression by promoting transcription. In a genetic screen using Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified that FACT maintains cell identities and acts as a barrier for transcription factor-mediated cell fate reprogramming. Strikingly, FACT\\'s role as a barrier to cell fate conversion is conserved in humans as we show that FACT depletion enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts. Such activity is unexpected because FACT is known as a positive regulator of gene expression, and previously described reprogramming barriers typically repress gene expression. While FACT depletion in human fibroblasts results in decreased expression of many genes, a number of FACT-occupied genes, including reprogramming-promoting factors, show increased expression upon FACT depletion, suggesting a repressive function of FACT. Our findings identify FACT as a cellular reprogramming barrier in C.\\xa0elegans and humans, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell fate protection. Host genetic profiling to increase drug safety in colorectal cancer from discovery to implementation Abstract Adverse events affect the pharmacological treatment of approximately 90% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at any stage of the disease. Chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin is the cornerstone of the pharmacological treatment of CRC. The introduction of novel targeted agents, as anti-EGFR (i.e. cetuximab, panitumumab) and antiangiogenic (i.e. bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, regorafenib, and ramucirumab) molecules, into the oncologist’s toolbox has led to significant improvements in the life expectancy of advanced CRC patients, but with a substantial increase in toxicity burden. In this respect, pharmacogenomics has largely been applied to the personalization of CRC chemotherapy, focusing mainly on the study of inhered polymorphisms in genes encoding phase I and II enzymes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC)/solute carrier (SLC) membrane transporters, proteins involved in DNA repair, folate pathway and immune response. These research efforts have led to the identification of some validated genetic markers of chemotherapy toxicity, for fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan. No validated genetic determinants of oxaliplatin-specific toxicity, as peripheral neuropathy, has thus far been established. The contribution of host genetic markers in predicting the toxicity associated with novel targeted agents’ administration is still controversial due to the heterogeneity of published data. Pharmacogenomics guidelines have been published by some international scientific consortia such as the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) strongly suggesting a pre-treatment dose adjustment of irinotecan based on UGT1A1*28 genotype and of fluoropyrimidines based on some DPYD genetic variants, to increase treatment safety. However, these recommendations are still poorly applied at the patient’s bedside. Several ongoing projects in the U.S. and Europe are currently evaluating how pharmacogenomics can be implemented successfully in daily clinical practice. The majority of drug-related adverse events are still unexplained, and a great deal of ongoing research is aimed at improving knowledge of the role of pharmacogenomics in increasing treatment safety. In this review, the issue of pre-treatment identification of CRC patients at risk of toxicity via the analysis of patients’ genetic profiles is addressed. Available pharmacogenomics guidelines with ongoing efforts to implement them in clinical practice and new exploratory markers for clinical validation are described. Association between cognition and the retinal microvasculature in 11-year old children born preterm or at term Background Retinal microvessels can be visualized non-invasively and mirror the status of the cerebral microvasculature. Aims To investigate whether in young children born prematurely or at term cognitive performance is related to retinal microvascular traits. Study design, subjects In 93 prematurely born infants (birth weight\\u202f<\\u202f1000\\u202fg) and 87 controls born at term, we measured head circumference (HC) and determined intelligence quotient (IQ) by combining matrix reasoning and spatial span (Wechsler Non-Verbal test, Dutch version) and post-processed retinal photographs using Singapore I Vessel Assessment software (version 3.6). Outcome measures, results Compared with controls, cases had smaller HC (51.7 vs 53.4\\u202fcm; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001), lower IQ (93.9 vs 109.2; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001), smaller retinal arteriolar (CRAE; 162.7 vs 174.0\\u202fμm; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) and venular (CRVE; 234.9 vs 242.8\\u202fμm; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.003) diameters and CRAE/CRVE ratio (0.69 vs 0.72; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.001). A 1-SD decrease in CRAE was associated with smaller HC (−0.53\\u202fcm; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) and lower total IQ (−3.74; p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001), matrix reasoning (−1.77; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.004) and spatial span (−2.03; p\\u202f=\\u202f0.002). These associations persisted after adjustment for sex and age and risk factors for cognitive impairment, including blood pressure, body mass index and parental educational attainment. Conclusions HC, total IQ, matrix reasoning and spatial span decrease with smaller retinal arteriolar diameter. Our findings suggest that maldevelopment of the cerebral microcirculation, as mirrored by the retinal microvasculature, has lasting effects on the growth of the brain and cognitive performance of prematurely born children. Climate change-driven coastal erosion modelling in temperate sandy beaches: Methods and uncertainty treatment Abstract Developing future projections of shoreline change requires a good understanding of the driving coastal processes. These processes result primarily from the combination of mean sea level, waves, storm surges and tides, which are affected by global and regional climate change, and whose uncertainty increases with time. This paper reviews the current state of the art of methods used to model climate change-induced coastal erosion focusing on how climate change-related drivers and the associated uncertainty are considered. We identify research gaps, describe and analyse the key components of a comprehensive framework to derive future estimates of shoreline change and make suggestions for good practice. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last decade, most of the studies limit uncertainty sampling to considering ranges of variation of forcing variables and ensembles of emissions scenarios, and applications with high level of probabilistic development remain few. Further research is necessary to fully (a) incorporate projected time series of coastal drivers into the erosion models, including bias correction; (b) sufficiently sample the uncertainty associated with each step of the top-down approach, including the consideration of different emission scenarios, inter- and intra-model variability, and multiple runs of erosion models or model ensembles; and (c) reduce uncertainty in shoreline change estimates by developing better datasets and model parameterisations, and progressing in detection and attribution. Mboat7 down-regulation by hyper-insulinemia induces fat accumulation in hepatocytes Background: Naturally occurring variation in Membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7), encoding for an enzyme involved in phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodelling, has been associated with fatty liver and hepatic disorders. Here, we examined the relationship between hepatic Mboat7 down-regulation and fat accumulation. Methods: Hepatic MBOAT7 expression was surveyed in 119 obese individuals and in experimental models. MBOAT7 was acutely silenced by antisense oligonucleotides in C57Bl/6 mice, and by CRISPR/Cas9 in HepG2 hepatocytes. Findings: In obese individuals, hepatic MBOAT7 mRNA decreased from normal liver to steatohepatitis, independently of diabetes, inflammation and MBOAT7 genotype. Hepatic MBOAT7 levels were reduced in murine models of fatty liver, and by hyper-insulinemia. In wild-type mice, Mboat7 was down-regulated by refeeding and insulin, concomitantly with insulin signalling activation. Acute hepatic Mboat7 silencing promoted hepatic steatosis in vivo and enhanced expression of fatty acid transporter Fatp1. MBOAT7 deletion in hepatocytes reduced the incorporation of arachidonic acid into phosphatidylinositol, consistently with decreased enzymatic activity, determining the accumulation of saturated triglycerides, enhanced lipogenesis and FATP1 expression, while FATP1 deletion rescued the phenotype. Interpretation: MBOAT7 down-regulation by hyper-insulinemia contributes to hepatic fat accumulation, impairing phosphatidylinositol remodelling and up-regulating FATP1.

We systematically characterise risks associated with decarbonisation pathways in fifteen case studies conducted in twelve countries around the world. We find that stakeholders from business, government, NGOs, and others supplied some 40 % of these risk inputs, significantly widening the scope of risks considered by academics and experts. Overall, experts and academics consider more economic risks and assess these with quantitative methods and models, while other stakeholders consider political risks more. To avoid losing sight of risks that cannot be easily quantified and modelled, including some economic risks, impact assessment modelling should be complemented with qualitative research and active stakeholder engagement. A systematic risk elicitation facilitates communication with stakeholders, enables better risk mitigation, and increases the chance of a sustainable transition.

Structure–activity relationship and conformational studies of the natural product cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 Abstract G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein-coupled receptors and involved in a plethora of important physiological processes. The natural product cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are the only known selective inhibitors of the Gq protein subfamily. So far, all reported YM-254890 and FR900359 analogs show no inhibition of other G protein subtypes except the Gq, G11 and G14 proteins. Here we report the rationalization of the high potency of FR900359 and efforts towards understanding the G protein subtype selectivity by synthesis of a collection of structurally and stereochemically diverse analogs of YM-254890 using an efficient synthetic protocol. We performed the first conformational study of YM-254890 in aqueous solution by NMR spectroscopy and replica exchange molecular dynamics, which suggested that the combined contribution of residues with appropriate size, stereochemistry and conformational stability are critical for inhibitory potency. Moreover, in addition to the fit of the binding pocket, more factors should be taken into consideration for the development of compounds targeting other G proteins. A Urinary Fragment of Mucin-1 Subunit α Is a Novel Biomarker Associated With Renal Dysfunction in the General Population INTRODUCTION: Sequencing peptides included in the urinary proteome identifies the parent proteins and may reveal mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease. METHODS: In 805 randomly recruited Flemish individuals (50.8% women; mean age, 51.1 years), we determined the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. We categorized eGFR according to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline. We analyzed 74\\xa0sequenced urinary peptides with a detectable signal in more than 95% of participants. Follow-up measurements of eGFR were available in 597 participants. RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, baseline eGFR decreased (P\\xa0≤ 0.022) with urinary fragments of mucin-1 (standardized association size expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2,\\xa0-4.48), collagen III (-2.84), and fibrinogen (-1.70) and was bi-directionally associated (P\\xa0≤ 0.0006) with 2 urinary collagen I fragments (+2.28 and\\xa0-3.20). The eGFR changes over 5 years (follow-up minus baseline) resulted in consistent estimates (P\\xa0≤ 0.025) for mucin-1 (-1.85), collagen (-1.37 to 1.43) and fibrinogen (-1.45) fragments. Relative risk of having or progressing to eGFR\\xa0<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was associated with mucin-1. Partial least-squares analysis confirmed mucin-1 as the strongest urinary marker associated with decreased eGFR, with a score of 2.47 compared with 1.80 for a collagen I fragment as the next contender. Mucin-1 predicted eGFR decline to\\xa0<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 over and above microalbuminuria (P\\xa0= 0.011) and retained borderline significance (P\\xa0= 0.05) when baseline eGFR was accounted for. DISCUSSION: In the general population, mucin-1 subunit α, an extracellular protein that is shed from renal tubular epithelium, is a novel biomarker associated with renal dysfunction. ispartof: Kidney International Reports vol:2 issue:5 pages:811-820 ispartof: location:United States status: published Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 by CKD273, a Urinary Proteomic Biomarker Introduction: CKD273 is a urinary biomarker, which in advanced chronic kidney disease predicts further deterioration. We investigated whether CKD273 can also predict a decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to\\xa0<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Methods: In analyses of 2087 individuals from 6 cohorts (46.4% women; 73.5% with diabetes; mean age, 46.1 years; eGFR\\xa0≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 100%; urinary albumin excretion rate [UAE]\\xa0≥20 μg/min, 6.2%), we accounted for cohort, sex, age, mean arterial pressure, diabetes, and eGFR at baseline and expressed associations per 1-SD increment in urinary biomarkers. Results: Over 5 (median) follow-up visits, eGFR decreased more with higher baseline CKD273 than UAE\\xa0(1.64\\xa0vs. 0.82 ml/min per 1.73 m2; P\\xa0< 0.0001). Over 4.6 years (median), 390 participants experienced a first renal endpoint (eGFR decrease by\\xa0≥10 to\\xa0<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and 172 experienced an endpoint sustained over follow-up. The risk of a first and sustained renal endpoint increased with UAE (hazard ratio\\xa0≥ 1.23; P\\xa0≤\\xa00.043) and CKD273 (≥ 1.20; P\\xa0≤ 0.031). UAE (≥20 μg/min) and CKD273 (≥0.154) thresholds yielded sensitivities of 30% and 33% and specificities of 82% and 83% (P\\xa0≤ 0.0001 for difference between UAE\\xa0and\\xa0CKD273 in proportion of correctly classified individuals). As continuous markers, CKD273 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.039), but\\xa0not UAE (P\\xa0= 0.065), increased the integrated discrimination improvement, while both UAE and CKD273\\xa0improved the net reclassification index (P\\xa0≤ 0.0003), except for UAE per threshold (P\\xa0=\\xa00.086). Discussion: In conclusion, while accounting for baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and covariables, CKD273 adds to the prediction of stage 3 chronic kidney disease, at which point intervention remains an achievable therapeutic target. ispartof: Kidney International Reports vol:2 issue:6 pages:1066-1075 ispartof: location:United States status: published Decarbonizing strategies of the retail sector following the Paris Agreement The retail industry is one of the top 10 most carbon-intensive sectors. This paper is original in addressing what has changed in corporate retail with the Paris Agreement, accessing trends to decarbonize the sector. A qualitative comparison was performed regarding the policy, strategy and energy-related building solutions of the top 27 global retailers, ranked according to their revenue, regarding the reporting periods of 2014-2015 and 2016-2017. For each retailer, data were searched on retailers? sustainability reports was organized in different tables according to the variables policy, strategy and energy-related building practice. A comparison analysis was carried out, in order to identify differentiating decarbonizing measures. Corporate governance is increasingly relevant to manage climate change issues. Strategies to decarbonize the retail sector include establishing ambitious energy goals, invest in sustainability of supply chain with more efficient logistics and in greener retail operations, with buildings designed and managed under a life-cycle perspective (energy-efficiency, renewable energy and natural refrigerants). Retailers are progressively aligning their energy targets to those of the Paris Agreement and converging in business principles and reporting standards. With forthcoming regulation on GHG emissions, retailers could benefit from a business case on low-carbon opportunities and financial incentives to accelerate low-carbon transition investments. Performance of microporous carbon electrodes for supercapacitors: Comparing graphene with disordered materials International audience; Over the past decades, the specific surface area and the pore size distribution have been identified as the main structural features that govern the performance of carbon-based supercapacitors. As a consequence, graphene nanostructures have been identified as strong candidates for maximizing their capacitance. However, this hypothesis could not be thoroughly tested so far due to the difficulty of synthesizing perfect materials with high pore accesibility and a sufficiently large density. Here we perform molecular simulations of a series of perforated graphene electrodes with single pore sizes ranging from 7 to 10 Angstroms in contact with an adsorbed ionic liquid, and compare the capacitances (using various metrics) to the one obtained with a typical disordered nanoporous carbon. The latter displays better performances, an observation that we explain by analyzing the structure of the liquid inside the pores. It appears that although the smaller pores are responsible for the largest surface charges, larger ones are also necessary to store the counter-ions and avoid the formation of detrimental opposite charges on the carbon. These results rationalize the need for disordered or activated carbon materials to design efficient supercapacitors. Frictional stability and earthquake triggering during fluid pressure stimulation of an experimental fault Abstract It is widely recognized that the significant increase of M > 3.0 earthquakes in Western Canada and the Central United States is related to underground fluid injection. Following injection, fluid overpressure lubricates the fault and reduces the effective normal stress that holds the fault in place, promoting slip. Although, this basic physical mechanism for earthquake triggering and fault slip is well understood, there are many open questions related to induced seismicity. Models of earthquake nucleation based on rate- and state-friction predict that fluid overpressure should stabilize fault slip rather than trigger earthquakes. To address this controversy, we conducted laboratory creep experiments to monitor fault slip evolution at constant shear stress while the effective normal stress was systematically reduced via increasing fluid pressure. We sheared layers of carbonate-bearing fault gouge in a double direct shear configuration within a true-triaxial pressure vessel. We show that fault slip evolution is controlled by the stress state acting on the fault and that fluid pressurization can trigger dynamic instability even in cases of rate strengthening friction, which should favor aseismic creep. During fluid pressurization, when shear and effective normal stresses reach the failure condition, accelerated creep occurs in association with fault dilation; further pressurization leads to an exponential acceleration with fault compaction and slip localization. Our work indicates that fault weakening induced by fluid pressurization can overcome rate strengthening friction resulting in fast acceleration and earthquake slip. Our work points to modifications of the standard model for earthquake nucleation to account for the effect of fluid overpressure and to accurately predict the seismic risk associated with fluid injection. Effect of water and rock composition on re-strengthening of cohesive faults during the deceleration phase of seismic slip pulses Abstract The elastic strain energy release rate and seismic waves emitted during earthquakes are controlled by the on-fault temporal evolution of the shear stress during rupture propagation. High velocity friction experiments highlighted that shear stress on the fault surface evolves rapidly during seismic slip pulses. This temporal evolution of shear stress is controlled by both fault weakening at seismic slip initiation and re-strengthening rate towards the end of slip. While numerous studies focused on fault weakening, less attention was given to co-seismic re-strengthening processes. Here we performed 53 friction experiments (normal stress ≤30 MPa, slip-rate ≤6.5 m\\xa0s −1 ) imposing constant slip acceleration and deceleration (7.8 m\\xa0s −2 ), on cohesive Carrara marble (99% calcite) and micro-gabbro (silicate-built rock) under dry, vacuum and water pressurized conditions. Microstructural observations showed that micro-gabbro accommodated seismic slip by bulk melting of the sliding surfaces, whereas Carrara marble by coupled decarbonation and grain-size dependent crystal plastic processes. Under room humidity conditions and low imposed power density (i.e., product of normal stress per slip rate), re-strengthening rate during the deceleration stage was up to ∼ 17 times faster in marble than in micrograbbro. In the latter, the re-strengthening rate increased slightly with the power density. The presence of water enhanced further this trend. On the contrary, in marbles the re-strengthening rate decreased drastically with power density and in the presence of water. Our experimental observations highlighted the first order importance of the mineralogy and rheology of the slip zone materials and, to a second order, of the presence of water in controlling co-seismic re-strengthening of faults during seismic slip deceleration. Contested energy futures, conflicted rewards? Examining low-carbon transition risks and governance dynamics in China\\'s built environment China\\'s urbanisation has caused city populations to grow rapidly, boosting continuous development and scaling up the construction industry more intensely. The building sector is thus a key area to consider for climate change mitigation efforts. This study initially seeks to explore the development of a green transition pathway for the Chinese building sector, informed by national and local low-carbon policies and strategies, with specific references to Beijing and Shanghai. Acknowledging that the barriers and impacts of these policies have not been explored in depth and in consideration of the multiplicity of stakeholder views, we then set out to collect stakeholders’ perspectives of implementation and consequential risks associated with the envisaged transition and with the policies aiming to promote this transition. These concerns are evaluated in a multiple-criteria group decision making approach. By focusing on the resulting most critical implementation barriers, we then outline five plausible socioeconomic scenarios, against which we simulate the impacts of the considered policy strategies on the low-carbon transition of the Chinese built environment as well the extent of their key possible negative consequences, by means of fuzzy cognitive maps. ISSN:2214-6296 The desirability of transitions in demand: Incorporating behavioural and societal transformations into energy modelling Quantitative systems modelling in support of climate policy has tended to focus more on the supply side in assessing interactions among technology, economy, environment, policy and society. By contrast, the demand side is usually underrepresented, often emphasising technological options for energy efficiency improvements. In this perspective, we argue that scientific support to climate action is not only about exploring capacity of “what”, in terms of policy and outcome, but also about assessing feasibility and desirability, in terms of “when”, “where” and especially for “whom”. Without the necessary behavioural and societal transformations, the world faces an inadequate response to the climate crisis challenge. This could result from poor uptake of low-carbon technologies, continued high-carbon intensive lifestyles, or economy-wide rebound effects. For this reason, we propose a framing for a holistic and transdisciplinary perspective on the role of human choices and behaviours in influencing the low-carbon transition, starting from the desires of individuals and communities, and analysing how these interact with the energy and economic landscape, leading to systemic change at the macro-level. In making a case for a political ecology agenda, we expand our scope, from comprehending the role of societal acceptance and uptake of end-use technologies, to co-developing knowledge with citizens from non-mainstream and marginalised communities, and to defining the modelling requirements to assess the decarbonisation potential of shifting lifestyle patterns in climate change and action. ISSN:2214-6296 The sp 2 -iminosugar glycolipid 1-dodecylsulfonyl-5 N ,6 O -oxomethylidenenojirimycin (DSO 2 -ONJ) as selective anti-inflammatory agent by modulation of hemeoxygenase-1 in Bv.2 microglial cells and retinal explants Neuroinflammation is an early event during diabetic retinopathy (DR) that impacts the dynamics of microglia polarization. Gliosis is a hallmark of DR and we have reported the beneficial effects of 1R-DSO-ONJ, a member of the sp2-iminosugar glycolipid (sp2-IGL) family, in targeting microglia and reducing gliosis in diabetic db/db mice. Herein, we analyzed the effect of DSO2-ONJ, another family compound incorporating a sulfone group that better mimics the phosphate group of phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues (PIAs), in Bv.2 microglial cells treated with bacterial lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and in retinal explants from db/db mice. In addition to decreasing iNOS and inflammasome activation, the anti-inflammatory effect of DSO2-ONJ was mediated by direct p38α MAPK activation. Computational docking experiments demonstrated that DSO2-ONJ binds to p38α MAPK at the same site where PIAs and the alkyl phospholipid perifosine activators do, suggesting similar mechanism of action. Moreover, treatment of microglial cells with DSO2-ONJ increased both heme-oxygenase (HO)-1 and Il10 expression regardless the presence of LPS. In retinal explants from db/db mice, DSO2-ONJ also induced HO-1 and reduced gliosis. Since IL-10-mediated induction of HO-1 expression is mediated by p38α MAPK activation, our results suggest that this molecular mechanism is involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of DSO2-ONJ in microglia. Differential effects of metformin glycinate and hydrochloride in glucose production, AMPK phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes from non-diabetic and diabetic mice The liver is a main target tissue of the biguanide metformin which activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We previously reported that administration of metformin glycinate showed a greater decrease of glycated hemoglobin A1c than a placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we compared the effects of metformin hydrochloride, the oral antidiabetic drug of first choice, with those of metformin glycinate in hepatocytes from non-diabetic and diabetic mice and humans. Both formulations were equally potent regard to the reduction of basal and glucagon-induced glucose production and mRNA levels of gluconeogenic enzymes (Pck1 and G6pc) in hepatocytes from C57/Bl6 mice and humans. On the contrary, phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) was faster in hepatocytes treated with metformin glycinate. Likewise, we found stronger reduction in hepatocytes from obese/diabetic db/db mice of glucagon-induced glucose output and more sustained AMPK phosphorylation after treatment with metformin glycinate. Importantly, insulin sensitization regarding phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) was enhanced in hepatocytes from db/db mice or humans pretreated with metformin glycinate. In conclusion, our data indicate that metformin glycinate may be an alternative therapy against insulin resistance during obesity and/or T2DM. High yield production of graphene-Fe 2 O 3 nano-composites via electrochemical intercalation of nitromethane and iron chloride, and their application in lithium storage Abstract We demonstrate a facile, scalable and tunable method to produce a composite material based on graphene multilayers and Fe2O3, combining the good conductivity and 2D layered structure of the former and the lithium storage capacity of the latter. The composite was obtained directly from bulk graphite, exploiting the fast electrochemical intercalation of tetrachloroferrate (III) anions (FeCl4−) and nitromethane molecules between the graphene sheets. Then, irradiation with microwaves triggered the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and its functionalization with Fe2O3 nanocrystals, produced by the thermal hydrolysis of the FeCl4−. This process was monitored in real time using thermal gravimetry and mass spectrometry. X-rays diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron and transmission microscopies confirmed the final structure of the composite formed by conductive 2D nanosheets coated by Fe2O3 crystals, featuring both high crystallinity and nanometric size. The composite could be used directly as an anode in Li-ion batteries, demonstrating the viability of this approach for high yield and scalable production of graphene/metal oxide composites. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic detoxification of 4-hydroxynonenal: Methodological aspects and biological consequences 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), an electrophilic end-product deriving from lipid peroxidation, undergoes a heterogeneous set of biotransformations including enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The former mostly involve red-ox reactions on the HNE oxygenated functions (phase I metabolism) and GSH conjugations (phase II) while the latter are due to the HNE capacity to spontaneously condense with nucleophilic sites within endogenous molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and phospholipids. The overall metabolic fate of HNE has recently attracted great interest not only because it clearly determines the HNE disposal, but especially because the generated metabolites and adducts are not inactive molecules (as initially believed) but show biological activities even more pronounced than those of the parent compound as exemplified by potent pro-inflammatory stimulus induced by GSH conjugates. Similarly, several studies revealed that the non-enzymatic reactions, initially considered as damaging processes randomly involving all endogenous nucleophilic reactants, are in fact quite selective in terms of both reactivity of the nucleophilic sites and stability of the generated adducts. Even though many formed adducts retain the expected toxic consequences, some adducts exhibit well-defined beneficial roles as documented by the protective effects of sublethal concentrations of HNE against toxic concentrations of HNE. Clearly, future investigations are required to gain a more detailed understanding of the metabolic fate of HNE as well as to identify novel targets involved in the biological activity of the HNE metabolites. These studies are and will be permitted by the continuous progress in the analytical methods for the identification and quantitation of novel HNE metabolites as well as for proteomic analyses able to offer a comprehensive picture of the HNE-induced adducted targets. On these grounds, the present review will focus on the major enzymatic and non-enzymatic HNE biotransformations discussing both the molecular mechanisms involved and the biological effects elicited. The review will also describe the most important analytical enhancements that have permitted the here discussed advancements in our understanding of the HNE metabolic fate and which will permit in a near future an even better knowledge of this enigmatic molecule. Chemistry and analysis of HNE and other prominent carbonyl-containing lipid oxidation compounds The process of lipid oxidation generates a diverse array of small aldehydes and carbonyl-containing compounds, which may occur in free form or esterified within phospholipids and cholesterol esters. These aldehydes mostly result from fragmentation of fatty acyl chains following radical oxidation, and the products can be subdivided into alkanals, alkenals (usually a,β-unsaturated), γ-substituted alkenals and bis-aldehydes. Isolevuglandins are non-fragmented di-carbonyl compounds derived from H2-isoprostanes, and oxidation of the ω-3-fatty acid docosahexenoic acid yield analogous 22 carbon neuroketals. Non-radical oxidation by hypochlorous acid can generate a-chlorofatty aldehydes from plasmenyl phospholipids. Most of these compounds are reactive and have generally been considered as toxic products of a deleterious process. The reactivity is especially high for the a,β-unsaturated alkenals, such as acrolein and crotonaldehyde, and for γ-substituted alkenals, of which 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 4-oxo-2-nonenal are best known. Nevertheless, in recent years several previously neglected aldehydes have been investigated and also found to have significant reactivity and biological effects; notable examples are 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal and 4-hydroxy-dodecadienal. This has led to substantial interest in the biological effects of all of these lipid oxidation products and their roles in disease, including proposals that HNE is a second messenger or signalling molecule. However, it is becoming clear that many of the effects elicited by these compounds relate to their propensity for forming adducts with nucleophilic groups on proteins, DNA and specific phospholipids. This emphasizes the need for good analytical methods, not just for free lipid oxidation products but also for the resulting adducts with biomolecules. The most informative methods are those utilizing HPLC separations and mass spectrometry, although analysis of the wide variety of possible adducts is very challenging. Nevertheless, evidence for the occurrence of lipid-derived aldehyde adducts in biological and clinical samples is building, and offers an exciting area of future research.

However, in the case of phospholipids (PL) studied under nitroxidative stress conditions, only nitroalkene derivatives of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), were reported when using both in vitro biomimetic conditions and in vivo model system of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, in order to further explore other nitroxidative modifications of PL, a biomimetic model of nitroxidation combined with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS approaches were used to characterize the nitrated and nitroxidized derivatives of PCs and PEs. Single and multiple nitrated derivatives of phospholipids (PLs) such as nitroso and dinitroso, nitro, dinitro, and nitronitroso derivatives, together with nitroxidized derivatives were identified. Further, the specific MS/MS fragmentation pathways of these products were studied. Product ions arising from loss of HNO and HNO2, from the combined loss of HNO (or HNO2) and polar head groups, [NOn-FA+On+H]+ and [NOn-FA+On-H]- (n=1-2) product ions corresponding to the modified fatty acyl chains were observed, depending on each modification. The knowledge obtained from the study of the MS/MS fragmentation pattern has allowed us to identify nitrated PCs, including NO2-PC, (NO2)2-PCs, (NO2)(NO)-PC, NO-PC; nitrated PEs, NO2-PEs; and nitroxidized PCs, (NO2)(2O)-PC in H9c2 cells under starvation, but not under ischemia or control conditions. The physiological relevance of this nitrated and nitroxidized PCs and PEs species observed exclusively in cardiomyoblast cells (H9c2) under starvation is still unknown but deserves to be explored. The cysteine residue of glial fibrillary acidic protein is a critical target for lipoxidation and required for efficient network organization The type III intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) contributes to the homeostasis of astrocytes, where it co-polymerizes with vimentin. Conversely, alterations in GFAP assembly or degradation cause intracellular aggregates linked to astrocyte dysfunction and neurological disease. Moreover, injury and inflammation elicit extensive GFAP organization and expression changes, which underline reactive gliosis. Here we have studied GFAP as a target for modification by electrophilic inflammatory mediators. We show that the GFAP cysteine, C294, is targeted by lipoxidation by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) in vitro and in cells. Electrophilic modification of GFAP in cells leads to a striking filament rearrangement, with retraction from the cell periphery and juxtanuclear condensation in thick bundles. Importantly, the C294S mutant is resistant to cyPG addition and filament disruption, thus highlighting the critical role of this residue as a sensor of oxidative damage. However, GFAP C294S shows defective or delayed network formation in GFAP-deficient cells, including SW13/cl.2 cells and GFAP- and vimentin-deficient primary astrocytes. Moreover, GFAP C294S does not effectively integrate with and even disrupts vimentin filaments in the short-term. Interestingly, short-spacer bifunctional cysteine crosslinking produces GFAP-vimentin heterodimers, suggesting that a certain proportion of cysteine residues from both proteins are spatially close. Collectively, these results support that the conserved cysteine residue in type III intermediate filament proteins serves as an electrophilic stress sensor and structural element. Therefore, oxidative modifications of this cysteine could contribute to GFAP disruption or aggregation in pathological situations associated with oxidative or electrophilic stress. Integrated approaches to unravel the impact of protein lipoxidation on macromolecular interactions Protein modification by lipid derived reactive species or lipoxidation is increased during oxidative stress, a common feature observed in many pathological conditions. Biochemical and functional consequences of lipoxidation include changes in the conformation and assembly of the target proteins, altered recognition of ligands and/or cofactors, changes in the interactions with DNA or protein-protein interactions, modifications in membrane partitioning and binding and/or subcellular localization. These changes may impact, directly or indirectly, signaling pathways involved in the activation of cell defense mechanisms, but when these are overwhelmed they may lead to pathological outcomes. Mass spectrometry provides state of the art approaches for the identification and characterization of lipoxidized proteins/residues and the modifying species. Nevertheless, understanding the complexity of the functional effects of protein lipoxidation requires the use of additional methodologies. Herein, biochemical and biophysical methods used to detect and measure functional effects of protein lipoxidation at different levels of complexity, from in vitro and reconstituted cell-like systems to cells, are reviewed, focusing especially on macromolecular interactions. Knowledge generated through innovative and complementary technologies will contribute to comprehend the role of lipoxidation in pathophysiology and, ultimately, its potential as target for therapeutic intervention. Computational solutions in redox lipidomics – Current strategies and future perspectives The high chemical diversity of lipids allows them to perform multiple biological functions ranging from serving as structural building blocks of biological membranes to regulation of metabolism and signal transduction. In addition to the native lipidome, lipid species derived from enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications (the epilipidome) make the overall picture even more complex, as their functions are still largely unknown. Oxidized lipids represent the fraction of epilipidome which has attracted high scientific attention due to their apparent involvement in the onset and development of numerous human disorders. Development of high-throughput analytical methods such as liquid chromatography coupled on-line to mass spectrometry provides the possibility to address epilipidome diversity in complex biological samples. However, the main bottleneck of redox lipidomics, the branch of lipidomics dealing with the characterization of oxidized lipids, remains the lack of optimal computational tools for robust, accurate and specific identification of already discovered and yet unknown modified lipids. Here we discuss the main principles of high-throughput identification of lipids and their modified forms and review the main software tools currently available in redox lipidomics. Different levels of confidence for software assisted identification of redox lipidome are defined and necessary steps toward optimal computational solutions are proposed. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry characterization of nitroso, nitrated and nitroxidized cardiolipin products Abstract Cardiolipins (CL) are anionic dimeric phospholipids bearing four fatty acids, found in inner mitochondrial membrane as structural components and are involved in several processes as oxidative phosphorylation or apoptotic signalling. As other phospholipids, CL can be modified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which can modulate various cellular functions. Modifications of CL by RNS remain largely unstudied although other nitrated lipids are emerging as bioactive molecules. In this work, we developed a C30-LC-HRMS/MS methodology to identify the nitrated and nitroxidized tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin (TLCL), using a biomimetic model of nitration, and to disclose specific fragmentation pathways under HCD MS/MS. Using this lipidomics approach, we were able to separate and identify nitro, nitroso, nitronitroso, and nitroxidized TLCL derivatives, comprising 11 different nitrated compounds. These products were identified using accurate mass measurements and the fragmentation pattern acquired in higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD)-tandem MS/MS experiments. These spectra showed classifying fragmentation pathways, yielding phosphatidic acid (PA−), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA−), and carboxylate fragment ions with the modifying moiety. Remarkably, the typical neutral losses associated with the added moieties were not observed. In conclusion, this work has developed a new method for the identification of nitroso, nitrated and nitroxidized cardiolipin products by using a C30LC-MS platform method, potentially allowing their detection in biological samples. Insight into the cellular effects of nitrated phospholipids: Evidence for pleiotropic mechanisms of action Nitrated phospholipids have been recently identified in biological systems and showed to display anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential in models of inflammation in vitro. Here, we have explored the effects of nitrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-phosphatidyl choline (NO2-POPC) in cellular models. We have observed that NO2-POPC, but not POPC, induces cellular changes consisting in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell shrinking, and ultimately, loss of cell adhesion or impaired cell attachment. NO2-POPC releases NO in vitro and induces accumulation of NO in cells. Nevertheless, the effects of NO2-POPC are not superimposable with those of NO donors, which points to distinctive mechanisms of action. Notably, they show a stronger parallelism, although not complete overlap, with the effects of nitrated fatty acids. Interestingly, redistribution of vimentin by NO2-POPC is attenuated in a C328S mutant, thus indicating that this residue may be a target for direct or indirect modification in NO2-POPC-treated cells. Additionally, NO2-POPC interacts with several typical lipoxidation targets in vitro, including vimentin and PPARγ constructs, likely through cysteine residues. Therefore, nitrated phospholipids emerge as potential novel electrophilic lipid mediators with selective actions. Evaluation of air oxidized PAPC: A multi laboratory study by LC-MS/MS Abstract Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) has been shown to play a crucial role in the onset and development of cardiovascular disorders. The study of oxLDL, as an initiator of inflammatory cascades, led to the discovery of a variety of oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) responsible for pro-inflammatory actions. Oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) is frequently used by the scientific community as a representative oxPL mixture to study the biological effects of oxidized lipids, due to the high abundance of PAPC in human tissues and the biological activities of oxidized arachidonic acids derivatives. Most studies focusing on oxPAPC effects rely on in-house prepared mixtures of oxidized species obtained by exposing PAPC to air oxidation. Here, we described a multi-laboratory evaluation of the compounds in oxPAPC by LC-MS/MS, focusing on the identification and relative quantification of the lipid peroxidation products (LPPs) formed. PAPC was air-oxidized in four laboratories using the same protocol for 0, 48, and 72\\u202fh. It was possible to identify 55 different LPPs with unique elemental composition and characterize different structural isomeric species within these. The study showed good intra-sample reproducibility and similar qualitative patterns of oxidation, as the most abundant LPPs were essentially the same between the four laboratories. However, there were substantial differences in the extent of oxidation, i.e. the amount of LPPs relative to unmodified PAPC, at specific time points. This shows the importance of characterizing air-oxidized PAPC preparations before using them for testing biological effects of oxidized lipids, and may explain some variability of effects reported in the literature. Pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects of glycated albumin on cardiomyocytes Abstract Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant circulating protein in the body and presents an extensive range of biological functions. As such, it is prone to undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs). The non-enzymatic early glycation of HSA, one of the several PTMs undergone by HSA, arises from the addition of reducing sugars to amine group residues, thus modifying the structure of HSA. These changes may affect HSA functions impairing its biological activity, finally leading to cell damage. The aim of this study was to quantitate glycated-HSA (GA) levels in the plasma of heart failure (HF) patients and to evaluate the biological effects of GA on HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Plasma GA content from HF patients and healthy subjects was measured by direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Results pointed out a significant increase of GA in HF patients with respect to the control group (p\\u202f Our findings show that plasma GA is increased in HF patients. Further, GA exerts pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects on cardiomyocytes, which suggest a causal role in the etiopathogenesis of HF. Patterns for High Performance Multiscale Computing Abstract We describe our Multiscale Computing Patterns software for High Performance Multiscale Computing. Following a short review of Multiscale Computing Patterns, this paper introduces the Multiscale Computing Patterns Software, which consists of description, optimisation and execution components. First, the description component translates the task graph, representing a multiscale simulation, to a particular type of multiscale computing pattern. Second, the optimisation component selects and applies algorithms to find the most suitable mapping between submodels and available HPC resources. Third, the execution component which a middleware layer maps submodels to the number and type of physical resources based on the suggestions emanating from the optimisation part together with infrastructure-specific metrics such as queueing time and resource availability. The main purpose of the Multiscale Computing Patterns software is to leverage the Multiscale Computing Patterns to simplify and automate the execution of complex multiscale simulations on high performance computers, and to provide both application-specific and pattern-specific performance optimisation. We test the performance and the resource usage for three multiscale models, which are expressed in terms of two Multiscale Computing Patterns. In doing so, we demonstrate how the software automates resource selection and load balancing, and delivers performance benefits from both the end-user and the HPC system level perspectives. Main controls on the stable carbon isotope composition of speleothems Abstract The climatic controls on the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of speleothem carbonate are less often discussed in the scientific literature in contrast to the frequently used stable oxygen isotopes. Various local processes influence speleothem δ13C values and confident and detailed interpretations of this proxy are often complex. A better understanding of speleothem δ13C values is critical to improving the amount of information that can be gained from existing and future records. This contribution aims to disentangle the various processes governing speleothem δ13C values and assess their relative importance. Using a large data set of previously published records we examine the spatial imprint of climate-related processes in speleothem δ13C values deposited post-1900 CE, a period during which global temperature and climate data is readily available. Additionally, we investigate the causes for differences in average δ13C values and growth rate under identical climatic conditions by analysing pairs of contemporaneously deposited speleothems from the same caves. This approach allows to focus on carbonate dissolution and fractionation processes during carbonate precipitation, which we evaluate using existing geochemical models. Our analysis of a large global data set of records reveals evidence for a temperature control, likely driven by vegetation and soil processes, on δ13C values in recently deposited speleothems. Moreover, data-model intercomparison shows that calcite precipitation occurring along water flow paths prior to reaching the top of the speleothem can explain the wide δ13C range observed for concurrently deposited samples from the same cave. We demonstrate that using the combined information of contemporaneously growing speleothems is a powerful tool to decipher controls on δ13C values, which facilitates a more detailed discussion of speleothem δ13C values as a proxy for climate conditions and local soil-karst processes. Comparing future patterns of energy system change in 2\\u202f°C scenarios to expert projections Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are computer-based instruments used to assess the implications of human activity on the human and earth system. They are simultaneously also used to explore possible response strategies to climate change. As IAMs operate simplified representations of real-world processes within their model structures, they have been frequently criticised to insufficiently represent the opportunities and challenges in future energy systems over time. To test whether projections by IAMs diverge in systematic ways from projections made by technology experts we elicited expert opinion on prospective change for two indicators and compared these with the outcomes of IAM studies. We specifically focused on five (energy) technology families (solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage or CCS) and compared the considered implications of the presence or absence of climate policy on the growth and diffusion of these technologies over the short (2030) to medium (2050) term. IAMs and experts were found to be in relatively high agreement on system change in a business-as-usual scenario, albeit with significant differences in the estimated magnitude of technology deployment over time. Under stringent climate policy assumptions, such as the internationally agreed upon objective to limit global mean temperature increase to no more than 2 °C, we found that the differences in estimated magnitudes became smaller for some technologies and larger for others. Compared to experts, IAM simulations projected a greater reliance on nuclear power and CCS to meet a 2 °C climate target. In contrast, experts projected a stronger growth in renewable energy technologies, particularly solar power. We close by discussing several factors that are considered influential to the alignment of the IAM and expert perspectives in this study. Multi-method evidence for when and how climate-related disasters contribute to armed conflict risk Abstract Climate-related disasters are among the most societally disruptive impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Their potential impact on the risk of armed conflict is heavily debated in the context of the security implications of climate change. Yet, evidence for such climate-conflict-disaster links remains limited and contested. One reason for this is that existing studies do not triangulate insights from different methods and pay little attention to relevant context factors and especially causal pathways. By combining statistical approaches with systematic evidence from QCA and qualitative case studies in an innovative multi-method research design, we show that climate-related disasters increase the risk of armed conflict onset. This link is highly context-dependent and we find that countries with large populations, political exclusion of ethnic groups, and a low level of human development are particularly vulnerable. For such countries, almost one third of all conflict onsets over the 1980-2016 period have been preceded by a disaster within 7 days. The robustness of the effect is reduced for longer time spans. Case study evidence points to improved opportunity structures for armed groups rather than aggravated grievances as the main mechanism connecting disasters and conflict onset. Climate change and harmful benthic microalgae Sea surface temperatures in the world’s oceans are projected to warm by 0.4–1.4\\u2009°C by mid twenty-first century causing many tropical and sub-tropical harmful dinoflagellate genera like Gambierdiscus, Fukuyoa and Ostreopsis (benthic harmful algal bloom species, BHABs) to exhibit higher growth rates over much of their current geographic range, resulting in higher population densities. The primary exception to this trend will be in the tropics where temperatures exceed species-specific upper thermal tolerances (30–31\\u2009°C) beyond which growth slows significantly. As surface waters warm, migration to deeper habitats is expected to provide refuge. Range extensions of several degrees of latitude also are anticipated, but only where species-specific habitat requirements can be met (e.g., temperature, suitable substrate, low turbulence, light, salinity, pH). The current understanding of habitat requirements that determine species distributions are reviewed to provide fuller understanding of how individual species will respond to climate change from the present to 2055 while addressing the paucity of information on environmental factors controlling small-scale distribution in localized habitats. Based on the available information, we hypothesized how complex environmental interactions can influence abundance and potential range extensions of BHAB species in different biogeographic regions and identify sentinel sites appropriate for long-term monitoring programs to detect range extensions and reduce human health risks Basin-specific changes in filamentous cyanobacteria community composition across four decades in the Baltic Sea Abstract Almost every summer, dense blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria are formed in the Baltic Sea. These blooms may cause problems for tourism and ecosystem services, where surface accumulations and beach fouling are commonly occurring. Future changes in environmental drivers, including climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, may further enhance these problems. By compiling monitoring data from countries adjacent to the Baltic Sea, we present spatial and temporal genus-specific distribution of diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria (Nostocales) during four decades (1979–2017). While the summer surface salinity decreased with a half up to one unit, the surface temperature in July-August increased with 2–3\\u2009°C in most sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, during the time period. The biovolumes of the toxic Nodularia spumigena did not change in any of the sub-basins during the period. On the other hand, the biovolume of the non-toxic Aphanizomenon sp. and the potentially toxic Dolichospermum spp. increased in the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, along with the decreased salinity and elevated temperatures, but Aphanizomenon sp. decreased in the southern parts despite decreased salinity and increased temperatures. These contradictory changes in biovolume of Aphanizomenon sp. between the northern and southern parts of the Baltic Sea may be due to basin-specific effects of the changed environmental conditions, or can be related to local adaptation by sub-populations of the genera. Overall, this comprehensive dataset presents insights to genus-specific bloom dynamics by potentially harmful diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea. Systematic analysis of ECG predictors of sinus rhythm maintenance after electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation Background Electrical cardioversion (ECV) is one of the rhythm control strategies in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Unfortunately, recurrences of AF are common after ECV, which significantly limits the practical benefit of this treatment in patients with AF. Objectives The objectives of this study were to identify noninvasive complexity or frequency parameters obtained from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to predict sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance after ECV and to compare these ECG parameters with clinical predictors. Methods We studied a wide variety of ECG-derived time- and frequency-domain AF complexity parameters in a prospective cohort of 502 patients with persistent AF referred for ECV. Results During 1-year follow-up, 161 patients (32%) maintained SR. The best clinical predictor of SR maintenance was antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment. A model including clinical parameters predicted SR maintenance with a mean cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.62 ± 0.05. The best single ECG parameter was the dominant frequency (DF) on lead V 6 . Combining several ECG parameters predicted SR maintenance with a mean AUC of 0.64 ± 0.06. Combining clinical and ECG parameters improved prediction to a mean AUC of 0.67 ± 0.05. Although the DF was affected by AAD treatment, excluding patients taking AADs did not significantly lower the predictive performance captured by the ECG. Conclusion ECG-derived parameters predict SR maintenance during 1-year follow-up after ECV at least as good as known clinical predictors of rhythm outcome. The DF proved to be the most powerful ECG-derived predictor. Phenotypic variability in LQT3 human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and their response to antiarrhythmic pharmacologic therapy: An in silico approach Background Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are in vitro models with the clear advantages of their human origin and suitability for human disease investigations. However, limitations include their incomplete characterization and variability reported in different cell lines and laboratories. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate in silico ionic mechanisms potentially explaining the phenotypic variability of hiPSC-CMs in long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) and their response to antiarrhythmic drugs. Methods Populations of in silico hiPSC-CM models were constructed and calibrated for control (n = 1,463 models) and LQT3 caused by INaL channelopathy (n = 1,401 models), using experimental recordings for late sodium current (INaL) and action potentials (APs). Antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by simulating mexiletine and ranolazine multichannel effects. Results As in experiments, LQT3 hiPSC-CMs yield prolonged action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) (+34.3% than controls) and large electrophysiological variability. LQT3 hiPSC-CMs with symptomatic APs showed overexpression of ICaL, IK1, and INaL, underexpression of IKr, and increased sensitivity to both drugs compared to asymptomatic LQT3 models. Simulations showed that both mexiletine and ranolazine corrected APD prolongation in the LQT3 population but also highlighted differences in drug response. Mexiletine stops spontaneous APs in more LQT3 hiPSC-CMs models than ranolazine (784/1,401 vs 53/1,401) due to its stronger action on INa. Conclusion In silico simulations demonstrate our ability to recapitulate variability in LQT3 and control hiPSC-CM phenotypes, and the ability of mexiletine and ranolazine to reduce APD prolongation, in agreement with experiments. The in silico models also identify potential ionic mechanisms of phenotypic variability in LQT3 hiPSC-CMs, explaining APD prolongation in symptomatic vs asymptomatic LQT3 hiPSC-CMs. Arterial hypertension drives arrhythmia progression via specific structural remodeling in a porcine model of atrial fibrillation Background: Arterial hypertension (HT) contributes to progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) via unknown mechanisms. Objective: We aimed to characterize electrical and structural changes accounting for increased AF stability in a large animal model of rapid atrial pacing (RAP)-induced AF combined with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-induced HT. Methods: Eighteen pigs were instrumented with right atrial endocardial pacemaker leads and custom-made pacemakers to induce AF by continuous RAP (600 beats/min). DOCA pellets were subcutaneously implanted in a subgroup of 9 animals (AF+HT group); the other 9 animals served as controls (AF group). Final experiments included electrophysiology studies, endocardial electroanatomic mapping, and high-density mapping with epicardial multielectrode arrays. In addition, 3-dimensional computational modeling was performed. Results: DOCA implantation led to secondary HT (median [interquartile range] aortic pressure 109.9 [100-137] mm Hg in AF+HT vs 82.2 [79-96] mm Hg in AF; P < .05), increased AF stability (55.6% vs 12.5% of animals with AF episodes lasting >1 hour; P < .05), concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial dilatation (119 ± 31 cm2 in AF+HT vs 78 ± 23 cm2 in AF; P < .05), and fibrosis. Collagen accumulation in the AF+HT group was mainly found in non-intermyocyte areas (1.62 ± 0.38 cm3 in AF+HT vs 0.96 ± 0.3 cm3 in AF; P < .05). Left and right atrial effective refractory periods, action potential durations, endo- and epicardial conduction velocities, and measures of AF complexity were comparable between the 2 groups. A 3-dimensional computational model confirmed an increase in AF stability observed in the in vivo experiments associated with increased atrial size. Conclusion: In this model of secondary HT, higher AF stability after 2 weeks of RAP is mainly driven by atrial dilatation. Material length scale of strain gradient plasticity: A physical interpretation Abstract The physical basis and the magnitude of the material length scale in theories of strain gradient plasticity are crucial for accounting for size effects in the plastic behavior of metals at small scales. However, the underlying physics of the length scale is ambiguous. The length scales in strain gradient plasticity theories in which the plastic work density can be expressed as a function of the gradient-enhanced plastic strain are here derived from known physical quantities via critical thickness theory. A connection between the length scale and the fundamental physical quantities is elucidated. The combination of the strain and strain-gradient terms within the deformation theory of strain gradient plasticity is addressed. It is shown that, compared with the harmonic sum of the strain and strain-gradient terms in Fleck-Hutchinson theory, the linear combination gives a more reasonable value of length scale, several micrometers, which is close to that in the gradient theory of Aifantis. In contrast, the value of length scale in Nix-Gao theory is much larger, in the millimeter range. The length scales determined by critical thickness theory are in good agreement with those obtained by fitting to experimental data of wire torsion. Direct Thrombin Inhibitors Prevent Left\\xa0Atrial Remodeling Associated With\\xa0Heart Failure in Rats Highlights • Oral direct anticoagulants such as DTIs, but not vitamin K antagonist, diminish the progression of atrial dilation associated with heart failure in a rat model. • Prevention of atrial dilation by DTI is associated with decreased duration of atrial arrhythmia induced by burst pacing. • DTI inhibits interstitial fibrosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and hypertrophy of atrial myocardium. • Plasma DTI concentrations inhibiting atrial remodeling are lower than those required for therapeutic anticoagulant activity. • DTIs may be of interest to prevent the progression of atrial fibrillation substrate in addition to their anticoagulant activity. PITX2 Modulates Atrial Membrane Potential and the Antiarrhythmic Effects\\xa0of\\xa0Sodium-Channel Blockers Background Antiarrhythmic drugs are widely used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanisms conveying their variable effectiveness are not known. Recent data suggested that paired like homeodomain-2 transcription factor (PITX2) might play an important role in regulating gene expression and electrical function of the adult left atrium (LA). Objectives After determining LA PITX2 expression in AF patients requiring rhythm control therapy, the authors assessed the effects of Pitx2c on LA electrophysiology and the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs. Methods LA PITX2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were measured in 95 patients undergoing thoracoscopic AF ablation. The effects of flecainide, a sodium (Na+)-channel blocker, and d,l-sotalol, a potassium channel blocker, were studied in littermate mice with normal and reduced Pitx2c mRNA by electrophysiological study, optical mapping, and patch clamp studies. PITX2-dependent mechanisms of antiarrhythmic drug action were studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing human Na channels and by modeling human action potentials. Results Flecainide 1 μmol/l was more effective in suppressing atrial arrhythmias in atria with reduced Pitx2c mRNA levels (Pitx2c+/–). Resting membrane potential was more depolarized in Pitx2c+/– atria, and TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK-2) gene and protein expression were decreased. This resulted in enhanced post-repolarization refractoriness and more effective Na-channel inhibition. Defined holding potentials eliminated differences in flecainide’s effects between wild-type and Pitx2c+/– atrial cardiomyocytes. More positive holding potentials replicated the increased effectiveness of flecainide in blocking human Nav1.5 channels in HEK293 cells. Computer modeling reproduced an enhanced effectiveness of Na-channel block when resting membrane potential was slightly depolarized. Conclusions PITX2 mRNA modulates atrial resting membrane potential and thereby alters the effectiveness of Na-channel blockers. PITX2 and ion channels regulating the resting membrane potential may provide novel targets for antiarrhythmic drug development and companion therapeutics in AF. High dietary fat intake induces a microbiota signature that promotes food allergy Background Diet-induced obesity and food allergies increase in tandem, but a potential cause-and-effect relationship between these diseases of affluence remains to be tested. Objective We sought to test the role of high dietary fat intake, diet-induced obesity, and associated changes in gut microbial community structure on food allergy pathogenesis. Methods Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12\\xa0weeks before food allergen sensitization on an atopic dermatitis–like skin lesion, followed by intragastric allergen challenge to induce experimental food allergy. Germ-free animals were colonized with a signature HFD or lean microbiota for 8\\xa0weeks before induction of food allergy. Food-induced allergic responses were quantified by using a clinical allergy score, serum IgE levels, serum mouse mast cell protease 1 concentrations, and type 2 cytokine responses. Accumulation of intestinal mast cells was examined by using flow cytometry and chloroacetate esterase tissue staining. Changes in the gut microbial community structure were assessed by using high-throughput 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing. Results HFD-induced obesity potentiates food-induced allergic responses associated with dysregulated intestinal effector mast cell responses, increased intestinal permeability, and gut dysbiosis. An HFD-associated microbiome was transmissible to germ-free mice, with the gut microbial community structure of recipients segregating according to the microbiota input source. Independent of an obese state, an HFD-associated gut microbiome was sufficient to confer enhanced susceptibility to food allergy. Conclusion These findings identify HFD-induced microbial alterations as risk factors for experimental food allergy and uncouple a pathogenic role of an HFD-associated microbiome from obesity. Postdieting microbiome alterations caused by overindulgence of dietary fat might increase susceptibility to food allergy. Reduced vascular endothelial growth factor levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with treatment resistant major depression and the effects of electroconvulsive therapy—A pilot study Abstract Background Several lines of evidence are pointing towards an involvement of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathophysiology of depression. There are studies analyzing blood levels of VEGF in patients with depression compared to controls, but a data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of VEGF in patients with depression are lacking. Method CSF VEGF levels were measured in patients (n\\u202f=\\u202f12) with a severe, treatment-resistant depressive episode before and after the antidepressant treatment by a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and compared to age- and sex-matched controls (n\\u202f=\\u202f20). Results The patients with depression showed lower mean VEGF levels in the CSF prior to ECT than the controls (p\\u202f=\\u202f0.041). Regarding the patients, CSF VEGF concentration at baseline and after the complete ECT treatment did not differ from each other (p\\u202f=\\u202f0.78). Limitations Major limitations of this study are the small sample size and that data from corresponding serum levels cannot be provided. Another limitation is that the controls were not completely healthy, as they were recruited from a memory clinic with subjective complaints. The timing of the second sample might have been suboptimal, when taking into account that there might be an on-going phase of re-equilibrating after ECT. Conclusions CSF VEGF concentrations were lower in a clinical sample of patients with treatment-resistant depression compared with matched controls. Additionally, no change in CSF VEGF levels during a course of ECT could be detected. Apolipoprotein E genotypes and longevity across dementia disorders Abstract Introduction The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene is a prominent risk factor for Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD), but its implication in other dementias is less well studied. Methods We used a data set on 2858 subjects (1098 AD, 260 vascular dementia [VaD], 145 mixed AD and VaD, 90 other dementia diagnoses, and 1265 controls) to examine the association of APOE polymorphisms with clinical dementia diagnoses, biomarker profiles, and longevity. Results The e4 allele was associated with reduced longevity as e4 versus e3 homozygotes lived on average 2.6\\xa0years shorter ( P \\xa0=\\xa0.006). In AD, e4 carriers lived 1.0\\xa0years shorter than noncarriers ( P \\xa0=\\xa0.028). The e4 allele was more prevalent in AD, mixed AD and VaD, and VaD patients compared to controls, but not in other dementia disorders. Discussion The APOE e4 allele is influential in AD but might also be of importance in VaD and in mixed AD and VaD, diseases in which concomitant AD pathology is common. Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid biomarker trajectories along the Alzheimer\\'s disease continuum in the BIOMARKAPD study Introduction: Within-person trajectories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are not well defined. Methods: We included 467 subjects from the BIOMARKAPD study with at least two serial CSF samples. Diagnoses were subjective cognitive decline (n = 75), mild cognitive impairment (n = 128), and AD dementia (n = 110), and a group of cognitively unimpaired subjects (n = 154) were also included. We measured baseline and follow-up CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), YKL-40, and neurofilament light (NfL). Median CSF sampling interval was 2.1 years. Results: CSF levels of t-tau, p-tau, NfL, and YKL-40 were 2% higher per each year of baseline age in controls (P <.001). In AD, t-tau levels were 1% lower (P <.001) and p-tau levels did not change per each year of baseline age. Longitudinally, only NfL (P <.001) and YKL-40 (P <.02) increased during the study period. Discussion: All four CSF biomarkers increase with age, but this effect deviates in AD for t-tau and p-tau. Comparison of variables associated with cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament, total-tau, and neurogranin Abstract Introduction Three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of neurodegeneration (N) (neurofilament light [NfL], total-tau [T-tau], and neurogranin [Ng]) have been proposed under the AT(N) scheme of the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer\\'s Association Research Framework. Methods We examined, in a community-based population (N\\xa0=\\xa0777, aged 50–95) (1) what variables were associated with each of the CSF (N) markers, and (2) whether the variables associated with each marker differed by increased brain amyloid. CSF T-tau was measured with an automated electrochemiluminescence Elecsys immunoassay; NfL and Ng were measured with in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results Multiple variables were differentially associated with CSF NfL and T-tau levels, but not Ng. Most associations were attenuated after adjustment for age and sex. T-tau had the strongest association with cognition in the presence of amyloidosis, followed by Ng. Variables associations with NfL did not differ by amyloid status. Discussion Understanding factors that influence CSF (N) markers will assist in the interpretation and utility of these markers in clinical practice. Improved biomechanical metrics of cerebral vasospasm identified via sensitivity analysis of a 1D cerebral circulation model Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is a life-threatening condition that occurs in a large proportion of those affected by subarachnoid haemorrhage and stroke. CVS manifests itself as the progressive narrowing of intracranial arteries. It is usually diagnosed using Doppler ultrasound, which quantifies blood velocity changes in the affected vessels, but has low sensitivity when CVS affects the peripheral vasculature. The aim of this study was to identify alternative biomarkers that could be used to diagnose CVS. We used a 1D modelling approach to describe the properties of pulse waves that propagate through the cardiovascular system, which allowed the effects of different types of vasospasm on waveforms to be characterised at several locations within a simulated cerebral network. A sensitivity analysis empowered by the use of a Gaussian process statistical emulator was used to identify waveform features that may have strong correlations with vasospasm. We showed that the minimum rate of velocity change can be much more effective than blood velocity for stratifying typical manifestations of vasospasm and its progression. The results and methodology of this study have the potential not only to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of vasospasm, but also to be used in the diagnosis of many other cardiovascular diseases where cardiovascular waves can be decoded to provide disease characterisation.

University Of Sheffield; Reino Unido A review of technology and policy deep decarbonization pathway options for making energy-intensive industry production consistent with the Paris Agreement Abstract The production of commodities by energy-intensive industry is responsible for 1/3 of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The climate goal of the Paris Agreement, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\\u202f°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\\u202f°C, requires global GHG emissions reach net-zero and probably negative by 2055–2080. Given the average economic lifetime of industrial facilities is 20 years or more, this indicates all new investment must be net-zero emitting by 2035–2060 or be compensated by negative emissions to guarantee GHG-neutrality. We argue, based on a sample portfolio of emerging and near-commercial technologies for each sector (largely based on zero carbon electricity & heat sources, biomass and carbon capture, and catalogued in an accompanying database), that reducing energy-intensive industrial GHG emissions to Paris Agreement compatible levels may not only be technically possible, but can be achieved with sufficient prioritization and policy effort. We then review policy options to drive innovation and investment in these technologies. From this we synthesize a preliminary integrated strategy for a managed transition with minimum stranded assets, unemployment, and social trauma that recognizes the competitive and globally traded nature of commodity production. The strategy includes: an initial policy commitment followed by a national and sectoral stakeholder driven pathway process to build commitment and identify opportunities based on local zero carbon resources; penetration of near-commercial technologies through increasing valuation of GHG material intensity through GHG pricing or tradable performance based regulations with protection for competitiveness and against carbon leakage; research and demand support for the output of pilot plants, including some combination of guaranteed above-market prices that decline with output and an increasing requirement for low carbon inputs in government procurement; and finally, key supporting institutions. Assessment of hydrogen direct reduction for fossil-free steelmaking Climate policy objectives require zero emissions across all sectors including steelmaking. The fundamental process changes needed for reaching this target are yet relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose and assess a potential design for a fossil-free steelmaking process based on direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen. We show that hydrogen direct reduction steelmaking needs 3.48\\u202fMWh of electricity per tonne of liquid steel, mainly for the electrolyser hydrogen production. If renewable electricity is used the process will have essentially zero emissions. Total production costs are in the range of 361–640 EUR per tonne of steel, and are highly sensitive to the electricity price and the amount of scrap used. Hydrogen direct reduction becomes cost competitive with an integrated steel plant at a carbon price of 34–68 EUR per tonne CO2 and electricity costs of 40 EUR/MWh. A key feature of the process is flexibility in production and electricity demand, which allows for grid balancing through storage of hydrogen and hot-briquetted iron, or variations in the share of scrap used. Bridging the computational gap between mesoscopic and continuum modeling of red blood cells for fully resolved blood flow Abstract We present a computational framework for the simulation of blood flow with fully resolved red blood cells (RBCs) using a modular approach that consists of a lattice Boltzmann solver for the blood plasma, a novel finite element based solver for the deformable bodies and an immersed boundary method for the fluid-solid interaction. For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM (npFEM) solver which has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used mass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling), such as an unconditional stability, versatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters to fully describe the behavior of the body at any mesh resolution. At the same time, the method is substantially faster than other FEM solvers proposed in this field, and has an efficiency that is comparable to the one of mesoscopic models. At its core, the solver uses specially defined potential energies, and builds upon them a fast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known material, our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related to the body viscoelasticity. In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for deformable bodies have more free parameters, and the calibration of the models demands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict their generality and mesh independence. We propose as well a modification to the potential energy proposed by Skalak et al. 1973 for the red blood cell membrane, which enhances the strain hardening behavior at higher deformations. Our viscoelastic model for the red blood cell, while simple enough and applicable to any kind of solver as a post-convergence step, can capture accurately the characteristic recovery time and tank-treading frequencies. The framework is validated using experimental data, and it proves to be scalable for multiple deformable bodies. Machine learning in the electrocardiogram Abstract The electrocardiogram is the most widely used diagnostic tool that records the electrical activity of the heart and, therefore, its use for identifying markers for early diagnosis and detection is of paramount importance. In the last years, the huge increase of electronic health records containing a systematised collection of different type of digitalised medical data, together with new tools to analyse this large amount of data in an efficient way have re-emerged the field of machine learning in healthcare innovation. This review describes the most recent machine learning-based systems applied to the electrocardiogram as well as pros and cons in the use of these techniques. Machine learning, including deep learning, have shown to be powerful tools for aiding clinicians in patient screening and risk stratification tasks. However, they do not provide the physiological basis of classification outcomes. Computational modelling and simulation can help in the interpretation and understanding of key physiologically meaningful ECG biomarkers extracted from machine learning techniques. Hepatic ceramides dissociate steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Background & Aims: Recent data in mice have identified de novo ceramide synthesis as the key mediator of hepatic insulin resistance (IR) that in humans characterizes increases in liver fat due to IR (\\'Metabolic NAFLD\\' but not that due to the I148M gene variant in PNPLA3 (\\'PNPLA3 NAFLD\\'). We determined which bioactive lipids co-segregate with IR in the human liver. Methods: Liver lipidome was profiled in liver biopsies from 125 subjects that were divided into equally sized groups based on median HOMA-IR (\\'High and Low HOMA-IR\\', n = 62 and n = 63) or PNPLA3 genotype (PNPIA3(148MM/MI), n = 61 vs. PNPLA3(148II), n = 64). The subjects were also divided into 4 groups who had either IR, the I148M gene variant, both of the risk factors or neither. Results: Steatosis and NASH prevalence were similarly increased in \\'High HOMA-IR\\' and PNPLA3(148MM/MI) groups compared to their respective control groups. The \\'High HOMA-IR\\' but not the PNPLA3(148MM/MI) group had features of IR. The liver in \\'High HOMA-IR\\' vs. low HOMA-IR\\' was markedly enriched in saturated and monounsaturated triacylglycerols and free fatty acids, dihydroceramides (markers of de novo ceramide synthesis) and ceramides. Markers of other ceramide synthetic pathways were unchanged. In PNPLA3(148MM/MI) vs. PNPLA3(148II), the increase in liver fat was due to polyunsaturated triacylglycerols while other lipids were unchanged. Similar changes were observed when data were analyzed using the 4 subgroups. Conclusions: Similar increases in liver fat and NASH are associated with a metabolically harmful saturated, ceramide-enriched liver lipidome in \\'Metabolic NAFLD\\' but not in \\'PNPLA3 NAFLD\\'. This difference may explain why metabolic but not PNPLA3 NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. (C) 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewed Impaired hepatic lipid synthesis from polyunsaturated fatty acids in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers with NAFLD Background: Carriers of the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 E167K gene variant (TM6SF2EK/KK) have decreased expression of the TM6SF2 gene and increased risk of NAFLD and NASH. Unlike common \\'obese/metabolic\\' NAFLD, these subjects lack hypertriglyceridemia and have lower risk of cardiovascular disease. In animals, phosphatidylcholine (PC) deficiency results in a similar phenotype. PCs surround the core of VLDL consisting of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesteryl-esters (CEs). We determined the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K on these lipids in the human liver and serum and on hepatic gene expression and studied the effect of TM6SF2 knockdown on hepatocyte handling of these lipids. Methods: Liver biopsies were taken from subjects characterized with respect to the TM6SF2 genotype, serum and liver lipidome, gene expression and histology. In vitro, after TM6SF2 knockdown in HuH-7 cells, we compared incorporation of different fatty acids into TGs, CEs, and PCs. Results: The TM6SF2EK/KK and TM6SF2EE groups had similar age, gender, BMI and HOMA-IR. Liver TGs and CEs were higher and liver PCs lower in the TM6SF2EK/KK than the TM6SF2EE group (p<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were deficient in liver and serum TGs and liver PCs but hepatic free fatty acids were relatively enriched in PUFA (p<0.05). Incorporation of PUFA into TGs and PCs in TM6SF2 knockdown hepatocytes was decreased (p<0.05). Hepatic expression of TM6SF2 was decreased in variant carriers, and was co-expressed with genes regulated by PUFAs. Conclusions: Hepatic lipid synthesis from PUFAs is impaired and could contribute to deficiency in PCs and increased intrahepatic TG in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers. Controlled attenuation parameter and alcoholic hepatic steatosis: Diagnostic accuracy and role of alcohol detoxification Background & Aims: Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel non-invasive measure of hepatic steatosis, but it has not been evaluated in alcoholic liver disease. Therefore, we aimed to validate CAP for the assessment of biopsy-verified alcoholic steatosis and to study the effect of alcohol detoxification on CAP. Methods: This was a cross-sectional biopsy-controlled diagnostic study in four European liver centres. Consecutive alcohol-overusing patients underwent concomitant CAP, regular ultrasound, and liver biopsy. In addition, we measured CAP before and after admission for detoxification in a separate single-centre cohort. Results: A total of 562 patients were included in the study: 269 patients in the diagnostic cohort with steatosis scores S0, S1, S2, and S3 = 77 (28%), 94 (35%), 64 (24%), and 34 (13%), respectively. CAP diagnosed any steatosis and moderate steatosis with fair accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ≥S1 = 0.77; 0.71–0.83 and AUC ≥S2 = 0.78; 0.72–0.83), and severe steatosis with good accuracy (AUC S3 = 0.82; 0.75–0.88). CAP was superior to bright liver echo pattern by regular ultrasound. CAP above 290 dB/m ruled in any steatosis with 88% specificity and 92% positive predictive value, while CAP below 220 dB/m ruled out steatosis with 90% sensitivity, but 62% negative predictive value. In the 293 patients who were admitted 6.3 days (interquartile range 4–6) for detoxification, CAP decreased by 32 ± 47 dB/m (p <0.001). Body mass index predicted higher CAP in both cohorts, irrespective of drinking pattern. Obese patients with body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 had a significantly higher CAP, which did not decrease significantly during detoxification. Conclusions: CAP has a good diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing severe alcoholic liver steatosis and can be used to rule in any steatosis. In non-obese but not in obese, patients, CAP rapidly declines after alcohol withdrawal. Lay summary: CAP is a new ultrasound-based technique for measuring fat content in the liver, but has never been tested for fatty liver caused by alcohol. Herein, we examined 562 patients in a multicentre setting. We show that CAP highly correlates with liver fat, and patients with a CAP value above 290 dB/m were highly likely to have more than 5% fat in their livers, determined by liver biopsy. CAP was also better than regular ultrasound for determining the severity of alcoholic fatty-liver disease. Finally, we show that three in four (non-obese) patients rapidly decrease in CAP after short-term alcohol withdrawal. In contrast, obese alcohol-overusing patients were more likely to have higher CAP values than lean patients, irrespective of drinking. Non-invasive prediction of esophageal varices by stiffness and platelet in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cirrhosis Background & aims: Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria can avoid the need for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to screen for varices needing treatment (VNT) in a substantial proportion of compensated patients with viral and/or alcoholic cirrhosis. This multicenter, cross-sectional study aims to validate these criteria in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), accounting for possible differences in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values between M and XL probes. Methods: We assessed 790 patients with NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis who had EGD within six months of a reliable LSM, measured by FibroScan® using M and/or XL probe. Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria were tested. The main variable used to optimize criteria was the percentage of endoscopies spared, keeping the risk of missing large VNT below a 5% threshold. Results: LSM was measured by both M and XL probes (training set) in 314 patients, while only M or XL probe (validation sets) were used to measure LSM in 338 and 138 patients, respectively. In the training set, use of Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria reduced the number of EGD by 33.3% and by 58%, with 0.9% and 3.8% of large esophageal varices missed, respectively. The best thresholds to rule-out VNT were identified as platelet count >110,000/mm3 and LSM <30 kPa for M probe, and platelet count >110,000/mm3 and LSM <25 kPa for XL probe (NAFLD cirrhosis criteria). Thus, usage of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria would have led to an absolute reduction in the number of EGD screened patients of 34.7% and 10.5% with respect to Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria, respectively. Conclusion: The new NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, established for the FibroScan probe, can reduce the use of EGD for screening of VNT in NAFLD cirrhosis by more than half, with a chance of missing VNT below 5%. Statins: Old drugs as new therapy for liver diseases? In addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins have pleiotropic effects, particularly anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antifibrotic, that may be beneficial in some chronic inflammatory conditions. Statins have only recently been investigated as a potential treatment option in chronic liver diseases because of concerns related to their safety in patients with impaired liver function. A number of experimental studies in animal models of liver diseases have shown that statins decrease hepatic inflammation, fibrogenesis and portal pressure. In addition, retrospective cohort studies in large populations of patients with cirrhosis and pre-cirrhotic conditions have shown that treatment with statins, with the purpose of decreasing high cholesterol levels, was associated with a reduced risk of disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma development, and death. These beneficial effects persisted after adjustment for disease severity and other potential confounders. Finally, a few randomised controlled trials have shown that treatment with simvastatin decreases portal pressure (two studies) and mortality (one study). Statin treatment was generally well tolerated but a few patients developed severe side effects, particularly rhabdomyolysis. Despite these promising beneficial effects, further randomised controlled trials in large series of patients with hard clinical endpoints should be performed before statins can be recommended for use in clinical practice. Fibrosis and alcohol-related liver disease Histological fibrosis stage is one of the most important prognostic factors in compensated and decompensated alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Morphological assessment of fibrosis is useful for patient stratification, enabling individualised management, and for evaluation of treatment effects in clinical studies. In contrast to most chronic liver diseases where fibrosis is portal-based, fatty liver disease (FLD) of alcoholic or non-alcoholic aetiology (NAFLD) is associated with a centrilobular pattern of injury which leads to perivenular fibrosis and/or pericellular fibrosis. Progression of FLD drives expansive pericellular fibrosis, linking vascular structures and paving the way for the development of cirrhosis. At the cirrhotic stage, ongoing tissue damage leads to increasing fibrosis severity due to parenchymal loss and proliferation of fibrous scars. Histologic fibrosis staging systems have been devised, based on topography and the extent of fibrosis, for most chronic liver diseases. The utility of histological staging is reflected in different risks associated with individual fibrosis stages which cannot be reliably distinguished by non-invasive fibrosis assessment. In contrast to NAFLD, ALD-specific staging systems that enable the standardised prognostication required for clinical management and trials are lacking. Although morphological similarities between NAFLD and ALD exist, differences in clinical and histological features may substantially limit the utility of established NAFLD-specific staging systems for prognostication in ALD. This review summarises morphological features of fibrosis in ALD and compares them to other chronic liver diseases, particularly NAFLD. ALD-related fibrosis is examined in the context of pathogenetic mechanisms of fibrosis progression, regression and clinical settings that need to be considered in future prognostically relevant ALD staging approaches. Genetic studies of abdominal MRI data identify genes regulating hepcidin as major determinants of liver iron concentration Background & Aims Excess liver iron content is common and is linked to the risk of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We aimed to identify genetic variants influencing liver iron content and use genetics to understand its link to other traits and diseases. Methods First, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,289 individuals from UK Biobank, whose liver iron level had been quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, before validating our findings in an independent cohort (n\\u202f=\\u202f1,513 from IMI DIRECT). Second, we used Mendelian randomisation to test the causal effects of 25 predominantly metabolic traits on liver iron content. Third, we tested phenome-wide associations between liver iron variants and 770 traits and disease outcomes. Results We identified 3 independent genetic variants (rs1800562 [C282Y] and rs1799945 [H63D] in HFE and rs855791 [V736A] in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron content that reached the GWAS significance threshold (p\\u202f<5\\u202f×\\u202f10−8). The 2 HFE variants account for ∼85% of all cases of hereditary haemochromatosis. Mendelian randomisation analysis provided evidence that higher central obesity plays a causal role in increased liver iron content. Phenome-wide association analysis demonstrated shared aetiopathogenic mechanisms for elevated liver iron, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and rheumatological conditions, while also highlighting inverse associations with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Conclusion Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying higher liver iron content are likely systemic rather than organ specific, that higher central obesity is causally associated with higher liver iron, and that liver iron shares common aetiology with multiple metabolic and non-metabolic diseases. Lay summary Excess liver iron content is common and is associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content. Crosstalk between adipose tissue insulin resistance and liver macrophages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Background & Aims: The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. We undertook this study to elucidate the interplay between macrophage activation, insulin resistance (IR) in target organs/tissues and hepatic damage. Methods: In 40 non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD we assessed: i) endogenous glucose production (EGP), glucose clearance and indexes of IR in the adipose tissue (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) and in the liver (Hep-IR) by tracer infusion ([6,6-2H2]glucose and [2H5]glycerol); ii) macrophage activity (by soluble sCD163) and iii) hepatic expression of CD163 (hCD163). Results: We found that sCD163 levels paralleled both the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels and lipolysis from adipose tissue. Consistently, sCD163 significantly correlated with adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR: r = 0.32, p = 0.042; Lipo-IR: r = 0.39, p = 0.012). At multiple regression analysis, sCD163 levels were associated with FFA levels (r p = 0.35, p = 0.026). In vitro exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to palmitate enhanced sCD163 secretion. Conversely, sCD163 did not correlate with EGP or with Hep-IR. In the liver, hCD163 positively correlated with sCD163 (r = 0.58, p = 0.007) and the degree of steatosis (r = 0.34, p = 0.048), but not with EGP or Hep-IR (r = −0.27 and r = 0.11, respectively, p >0.10, both). Conclusions: Our findings suggest a link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, possibly in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes. Conversely, our findings do not support a link between activated hepatic macrophages and glucose metabolism (EGP or Hep-IR). The relationship between adipose tissue IR and hepatic macrophages should be considered to define therapeutic targets for NAFLD. Lay summary: The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the insulin resistant state. This study provides in vivo support for a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to free fatty acid overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes. Total area of spontaneous portosystemic shunts independently predicts hepatic encephalopathy and mortality in liver cirrhosis Background & Aims: Spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) frequently develop in liver cirrhosis. Recent data suggested that the presence of a single large SPSS is associated with complications, especially overt hepatic encephalopathy (oHE). However, the presence of >1 SPSS is common. This study evaluates the impact of total cross-sectional SPSS area (TSA) on outcomes in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: In this retrospective international multicentric study, CT scans of 908 cirrhotic patients with SPSS were evaluated for TSA. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Each detected SPSS radius was measured and TSA calculated. One-year survival was the primary endpoint and acute decompensation (oHE, variceal bleeding, ascites) was the secondary endpoint. Results: A total of 301 patients (169 male) were included in the training cohort. Thirty percent of all patients presented with >1 SPSS. A TSA cut-off of 83 mm2 was used to classify patients with small or large TSA (S-/L-TSA). Patients with L-TSA presented with higher model for end-stage liver disease score (11 vs. 14) and more commonly had a history of oHE (12% vs. 21%, p <0.05). During follow-up, patients with L-TSA experienced more oHE episodes (33% vs. 47%, p <0.05) and had lower 1-year survival than those with S-TSA (84% vs. 69%, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis identified L-TSA (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% CI 1.02–2.70, p <0.05) as an independent predictor of mortality. An independent multicentric validation cohort of 607 patients confirmed that patients with L-TSA had lower 1-year survival (77% vs. 64%, p <0.001) and more oHE development (35% vs. 49%, p <0.001) than those with S-TSA. Conclusion: This study suggests that TSA >83 mm2 increases the risk for oHE and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Our results support the clinical use of TSA/SPSS for risk stratification and decision-making in the management of patients with cirrhosis. Lay summary: The prevalence of spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) is higher in patients with more advanced chronic liver disease. The presence of more than 1 SPSS is common in advanced chronic liver disease and is associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy. This study shows that total cross-sectional SPSS area (rather than diameter of the single largest SPSS) predicts survival in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. Our results support the clinical use of total cross-sectional SPSS area for risk stratification and decision-making in the management of SPSS.

Macarena Simón-Talero is a recipient of the grant JR 17/00029 from Instituto de Salud Carlos III Rebleeding and mortality risk are increased by ACLF but reduced by pre-emptive TIPS Background & aims: The relationship between acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is poorly understood. Specifically, the prevalence and prognosis of ACLF in the context of AVB is unclear, while the role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management in patients with ACLF has not been described to date. Methods: A multicenter, international, observational study was conducted in 2,138 patients from 34 centers between 2011 and 2015. ACLF was defined and graded according to the EASL-CLIF consortium definition. Placement of pre-emptive TIPS (pTIPS) was based on individual center policy. Patients were followed-up for 1 year, until death or liver transplantation. Cox regression and competing risk models (Gray\\'s test) were used to identify independent predictors of rebleeding or mortality. Results: At admission, 380/2,138 (17.8%) patients had ACLF according to EASL-CLIF criteria (grade 1: 38.7%; grade 2: 39.2%; grade 3: 22.1%). The 42-day rebleeding (19% vs. 10%; p <0.001) and mortality (47% vs. 10%; p <0.001) rates were higher in patients with ACLF and increased with ACLF grades. Of note, the presence of ACLF was independently associated with rebleeding and mortality. pTIPS placement improved survival in patients with ACLF at 42 days and 1 year. This effect was also observed in propensity score matching analysis of 66 patients with ACLF, of whom 44 received pTIPs and 22 did not. Conclusions: This large multicenter international real-life study identified ACLF at admission as an independent predictor of rebleeding and mortality in patients with AVB. Moreover, pTIPS was associated with improved survival in patients with ACLF and AVB. Lay summary: Acute variceal bleeding is a deadly complication of liver cirrhosis that results from severe portal hypertension. This study demonstrates that the presence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the strongest predictor of mortality in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Importantly, patients with ACLF and acute variceal (re)bleeding benefit from pre-emptive (early) placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

Performance of the PRO-C3 collagen neo-epitope biomarker in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Background & Aim There is an unmet need for non-invasive biomarkers in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can diagnose advanced disease and identify patients suitable for clinical trials. The PRO-C3 collagen neo-epitope is a putative direct marker of fibrogenesis. We assessed the performance of PRO-C3 in a large, well-characterised international NAFLD cohort and report the development and validation of 2 novel panels for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (F≥3) in NAFLD, including a simplified clinical score which eliminates the need for online calculators. Methods Plasma PRO-C3 levels were determined in a prospectively recruited international cohort of 449 patients with biopsy diagnosed NAFLD across the full disease spectrum (F0: n = 90; F1: 100; F2: 92; F3: 101; F4: 66). The cohort was divided into a discovery group (n = 151) and a validation group (n = 298). Logistic regression was performed to establish complex (FIBC3) and simplified (ABC3D) diagnostic scores that accurately identify advanced fibrosis. Performance for each was compared to established non-invasive fibrosis scoring systems. Results Plasma PRO-C3 levels correlated with grade of histological steatohepatitis (rs = 0.367, p ≪0.0001) and stage of fibrosis (rs = 0.462, p ≪0.0001), exhibiting similar performance to current fibrosis scores such as FIB4 for the detection of F≥3 fibrosis. FIBC3 exhibited substantially improved accuracy (AUROC 0.89 and 0.83 in the discovery and validation sets, respectively) and outperformed FIB4 and other similar diagnostic panels. The simplified version, ABC3D, was concurrently developed and had comparable diagnostic accuracy (AUROC 0.88 and 0.81 in the discovery and validation sets, respectively). Conclusion Plasma PRO-C3 levels correlate with severity of steatohepatitis and fibrosis stage. The FIBC3 panel is an accurate tool with a single threshold value that maintains both sensitivity and specificity for the identification of F≥3 fibrosis in NAFLD, eliminating indeterminate results and outperforming commonly used non-invasive tools. A greatly simplified version (ABC3D) that is readily amenable to use in the clinic has been validated and shown to perform with similar accuracy, and may prove a useful tool in routine clinical practice. Lay summary We performed a comprehensive, independent evaluation of a collagen biomarker (PRO-C3) to detect and quantify liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We report the development of 2 diagnostic panels using PRO-C3 to identify patients with advanced fibrosis, one optimal but more complex to calculate (FIBC3), the other easier to use (ABC3D) whilst still performing well. From NASH to diabetes and from diabetes to NASH: Mechanisms and treatment options Summary: The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to have reached 25% or more in adults. NAFLD is prevalent in obese individuals, but may also affect non-obese insulin-resistant individuals. NAFLD is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), which may be higher in patients with more severe liver disease – fibrosis increases this risk. In NAFLD, not only the close association with obesity, but also the impairment of many metabolic pathways, including decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, increase the risk of developing T2D and related comorbidities. Conversely, patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence of steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. Genetics and mechanisms involving dysfunctional adipose tissue, lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity appear to play a role. In this review, we discuss the altered pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the development of T2D in NAFLD and vice versa. Although there is no approved therapy for the treatment of NASH, we discuss pharmacological agents currently available to treat T2D that could potentially be useful for the management of NASH. Complex influences of meteorological drought time-scales on hydrological droughts in natural basins of the contiguous Unites States We analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous U.S. Specifically, this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations, covering the period 1940–2013. Drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model. In addition to meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand), we obtained a number of topographic, soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin. A hydrological drought index (the Standardized Streamflow Index; SSI) was computed for each basin and linked to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity. The relationships between different SPEI time-scales and their corresponding SSI were assessed by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient. Also, the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis. Overall, results demonstrate a positive response of SSI to SPEI at shorter time-scales, with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences. We also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis. Results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of SSI to SPEI time-scales. Similar analyses were made for three sub-periods (1940–1964, 1965–1989 and 1989–2013), whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of SSI to SPEI over the past eighty years. LncRNAs expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients LncRNA PCR arrays containing 90 common LncRNAs were used to screen lncRNA expression levels in PBMC from a discovery population of patients with MS. Data from discovery and replications cohorts showed a generalized dysregulation of lncRNA levels in MS patients compared with controls. MALAT1, MEG9, NRON, ANRIL, TUG1, XIST, SOX2OT, GOMAFU, HULC, BACE-1AS were significantly downregulated in MS patients in comparison with controls. Therefore, we performed a validation analysis in an independent cohort of Belgian origin. In this study, NRON and TUG1 downregulations in MS patients compared with controls were confirmed (p\\u202f≤\\u202f.05 and p\\u202f≤\\u202f.0001 respectively), whereas considering the other lncRNAs, the statistical threshold was not reached. LncRNAs profiling could thus represent a new challenge in the research of easy detectable biomarkers of disease susceptibility and progression. ispartof: Journal Of Neuroimmunology vol:324 pages:129-135 ispartof: location:Netherlands status: Published online Multiscale computing in the exascale era We expect that multiscale simulations will be one of the main high performance computing workloads in the exascale era. We propose multiscale computing patterns as a generic vehicle to realise load balanced, fault tolerant and energy aware high performance multiscale computing. Multiscale computing patterns should lead to a separation of concerns, whereby application developers can compose multiscale models and execute multiscale simulations, while pattern software realises optimized, fault tolerant and energy aware multiscale computing. We introduce three multiscale computing patterns, present an example of the extreme scaling pattern, and discuss our vision of how this may shape multiscale computing in the exascale era. Load balancing of parallel cell-based blood flow simulations Abstract The non-homogeneous distribution of computational costs is often challenging to handle in highly parallel applications. Using a methodology based on fractional overheads, we studied the fractional load imbalance overhead in a high-performance biofluid simulation aiming to accurately resolve blood flow on a cellular level. In general, the concentration of particles in such a suspension flow is not homogeneous. Usually, there is a depletion of cells close to walls, and a higher concentration towards the centre of the flow domain. We perform parallel simulations of such suspension flows. The emerging non-homogeneous cell distributions might lead to strong load imbalance, resulting in deterioration of the parallel performance. We formulate a model for the fractional load imbalance overhead, validate it by measuring this overhead in parallel lattice Boltzmann based cell-based blood flow simulations, and compare the arising load imbalance with other sources of overhead, in particular the communication overhead. We find a good agreement between the measurements and our load imbalance model. We also find that in our test cases, the communication overhead was higher than the load imbalance overhead. However, for larger systems, we expect load imbalance overhead to be dominant. Thus, efficient load balancing strategies should be developed. Effective phospholipids removing microelution-solid phase extraction LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous plasma quantification of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole: Application to human pharmacokinetic studies A simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, in human plasma. Stable isotopically labeled aripiprazole, aripiprazole-D8, has been used as the internal standard (IS) for both analytes. Only 200\\u202fμl of human plasma was needed for analyte extraction, using effective phospholipids-eliminating three-step microelution-solid-phase extraction (SPE, Oasis PRiME HLB 96-well μElution Plate). An ACE C18-PFP column was applied for chromatographic separation at 25\\u202f°C, protected by a 0.2-μm on-line filter. A combination of ammonium formate (5\\u202fmM)-acetonitrile (pH 4.0; 65:35, v/v) was used as mobile phase and the chromatogram was run under gradient conditions at a flow rate of 0.6\\u202fml/min. Run time lasted 5\\u202fmin, followed by a re-equilibration time of 3\\u202fmin, to give a total run time of 8\\u202fmin. Five μl of the sample was injected into the chromatographic system. Aripiprazole, dehydro-aripiprazole and IS were detected using the mode multiple reaction monitoring in the positive ionization mode. The method was linear in the concentration range of 0.18–110\\u202fng/ml and 0.35–100\\u202fng/ml for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Our method has been validated according to the recommendations of regulatory agencies through tests of precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, stability, sensitivity, selectivity and carry-over. Our microelution-SPE method removes more than 99% of main plasma phospholipids compared to protein precipitation and was successfully applied to several bioequivalence studies. Proteomics in cardiovascular diseases: Unveiling sex and gender differences in the era of precision medicine Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the most important cause of mortality in women and in men. Contrary to the long-standing notion that the effects of the major risk factors on CVD outcomes are the same in both sexes, recent evidence recognizes new, potentially independent, sex/gender-related risk factors for CVDs, and sex/gender-differences in the clinical presentation of CVDs have been demonstrated. Furthermore, some therapeutic options may not be equally effective and safe in men and women. In this context, proteomics offers an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches that expand from the screening of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CDVs. In this review, we summarized the current applications of proteomics in the cardiovascular field, with emphasis on sex and gender-related differences in CVDs. Significance Increasing evidence supports the profound effect of sex and gender on cardiovascular physio-pathology and the response to drugs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in CVDs would not only improve our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases, but could also inform health policy makers and guideline committees in tailoring specific interventions for the prevention, treatment and management of CVDs in both men and women. Liver fibrosis: Direct antifibrotic agents and targeted therapies Liver fibrosis and in particular cirrhosis are the major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic liver disease. Their prevention or reversal have become major endpoints in clinical trials with novel liver specific drugs. Remarkable progress has been made with therapies that efficiently address the cause of the underlying liver disease, as in chronic hepatitis B and C. Highly effective antiviral therapy can prevent progression or even induce reversal in the majority of patients, but such treatment remains elusive for the majority of liver patients with advanced alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, genetic or autoimmune liver diseases. Moreover, drugs that would speed up fibrosis reversal are needed for patients with cirrhosis, since even with effective causal therapy reversal is slow or the disease may further progress. Therefore, highly efficient and specific antifibrotic agents are needed that can address advanced fibrosis, i.e., the detrimental downstream result of all chronic liver diseases. This review discusses targeted antifibrotic therapies that address molecules and mechanisms that are central to fibrogenesis or fibrolysis, including strategies that allow targeting of activated hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts and other fibrogenic effector cells. Focus is on collagen synthesis, integrins and cells and mechanisms specific including specific downregulation of TGFbeta signaling, major extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM-crosslinking, and ECM-receptors such as integrins and discoidin domain receptors, ECM-crosslinking and methods for targeted delivery of small interfering RNA, antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules to increase potency and reduce side effects. With an increased understanding of the biology of the ECM and liver fibrosis and an improved preclinical validation, the translation of these approaches to the clinic is currently ongoing. Application to patients with liver fibrosis and a personalized treatment is tightly linked to the development of noninvasive biomarkers of fibrosis, fibrogenesis and fibrolysis. Application of graphene-based flexible antennas in consumer electronic devices Abstract We describe the fabrication and characterization of Near-Field Communication (NFC) devices based on highly flexible, carbon-based antennas composed of stacked graphene multilayers. This material features a high value of conductivity (4.20\\u202f*\\u202f10 5 \\u202fS/m) comparable to monocrystalline graphite, but is much more flexible and processable. We first studied the replacement of metal with carbon antennas using computer modeling, to select the best design. Then we manufactured several devices to be used according to the communication protocol ISO/IEC 15693. The inductance of the G-paper antennas was tested before and after hundreds of thousands of bending cycles at bending radii of 45 and 90\\u202fmm. During bending the self-resonance frequency and inductance peak showed minimal variation and the resistance at 1\\u202fMHz changed from 33.09\\u202fΩ to 34.18\\u202fΩ, outperforming standard, commercial metallic antennas. The devices were successfully tested by exchanging data with a smartphone and other commercial NFC readers, matching the performance of standard, commercial metallic antennas. The graphene antennas could be deposited on different standard polymeric substrates or on textiles. Smart cards, flexible NFC tags and wearable NFC bracelets were prepared in this way to be used in electronic keys, business cards and other typical NFC applications. Functional roles and metabolic niches in the honey bee gut microbiota Gut microbiota studies on diverse animals facilitate our understanding of the general principles governing microbiota-host interactions. The honey bee adds a relevant study system due to the simplicity and experimental tractability of its gut microbiota, but also because bees are important pollinators that suffer from population declines worldwide. The use of gnotobiotic bees combined with genetic tools, \\'omics\\' analysis, and experimental microbiology has recently provided important insights about the impact of the microbiota on bee health and the general functioning of gut ecosystems. Zika virus infection: an update International audience; Since the ZIKV outbreak in Brazil in 2015, the scientific community has joined efforts to gather more information on the epidemiology, clinical features and pathogenicity of the virus. Here, we summarize the most important advances made recently and discuss promising, innovative approaches to understand and control ZIKV infection. 30 years of microfluidics Abstract Microfluidics provides a great opportunity to create devices capable of outperforming classical techniques in biomedical and chemical research. In this review, the origins of this emerging field in the microelectronics industry are detailed. We also appraise how factors such as government funding influenced the development of new materials and fabrication techniques. Current applications of microfluidics are also examined and we highlight areas where work should be focussed in the future to ensure that the technology realises its full potential. Demonstration of full tensor current density imaging using ultra-low field MRI Direct imaging of impressed dc currents inside the head can provide valuable conductivity information, possibly improving electro-magnetic neuroimaging. Ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging (ULF MRI) at _$\\\\mu_$T Larmor fields can be utilized for current density imaging (CDI). Here, a measurable impact of the magnetic field _$B_{J}_$, generated by the impressed current density _$J_$, on the MR signal is probed using specialized sequences. In contrast to high-field MRI, the full tensor of _$B_{J}_$ can be derived without rotation of the subject in the scanner, due to a larger flexibility in the sequence design. We present an ULF MRI setup based on a superconducting quantum nterference device (SQUID), which is operating at a noise level of 380 aT Hz_$^{-1/2}_$ and capable of switching all imaging fields within a pulse sequence. Thereby, the system enables zero-field encoding, where the full tensor of _$B_{J}_$ is probed in the absence of other magnetic fields. 3D CDI is demonstrated on phantoms with different geometries carrying currents of approximately 2 mA corresponding to current densities between 0.45 and 8 A/m_$^{2}_$. By comparison to an in vivo acquired head image, we provide insights to necessary improvements in signal-to-noise ratio. The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR139 is activated by the peptides: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), α-, and β-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH, and β-MSH), and the conserved core motif HFRW GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed primarily in the brain. Not much is known regarding the function of GPR139. Recently we have shown that GPR139 is activated by the amino acids l-tryptophan and l-phenylalanine (EC50 values of 220\\xa0μM and 320\\xa0μM, respectively), as well as di-peptides comprised of aromatic amino acids. This led us to hypothesize that GPR139 may be activated by peptides. Sequence alignment of the binding cavities of all class A GPCRs, revealed that the binding pocket of the melanocortin 4 receptor is similar to that of GPR139. Based on the chemogenomics principle “similar targets bind similar ligands”, we tested three known endogenous melanocortin 4 receptor agonists; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and α- and β-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH and β-MSH) on CHO-k1 cells stably expressing the human GPR139 in a Fluo-4 Ca2+-assay. All three peptides, as well as their conserved core motif HFRW, were found to activate GPR139 in the low micromolar range. Moreover, we found that peptides consisting of nine or ten N-terminal residues of α-MSH activate GPR139 in the submicromolar range. α-MSH1-9 was found to correspond to the product of a predicted cleavage site in the pre-pro-protein pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Our results demonstrate that GPR139 is a peptide receptor, activated by ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, the conserved core motif HFRW as well as a potential endogenous peptide α-MSH1-9. Further studies are needed to determine the functional relevance of GPR139 mediated signaling by these peptides. Alzheimer\\'s disease markers in the aged sheep (Ovis aries) This study reports the identification and characterization of markers of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) in aged sheep (Ovis aries) as a preliminary step toward making a genetically modified large animal model of AD. Importantly, the sequences of key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis are highly conserved between sheep and human. The processing of the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein is conserved between sheep and human, and sheep Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also very similar to human. In addition, total tau and neurofilament light levels in CSF are comparable with those found in human. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in aged sheep brain has previously been established; here, we report for the first time that plaques, the other pathologic hallmark of AD, are also present in the aged sheep brain. In summary, the biological machinery to generate the key neuropathologic features of AD is conserved between the human and sheep, making the sheep a good candidate for future genetic manipulation to accelerate the condition for use in pathophysiological discovery and therapeutic testing. ALS-associated missense and nonsense TBK1 mutations can both cause loss of kinase function Mutations in TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Some TBK1 variants are nonsense and are predicted to cause disease through haploinsufficiency; however, many other mutations are missense with unknown functional effects. We exome sequenced 699 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and identified 16 TBK1 novel or extremely rare protein-changing variants. We characterized a subset of these: p.G217R, p.R357X, and p.C471Y. Here, we show that the p.R357X and p.G217R both abolish the ability of TBK1 to phosphorylate 2 of its kinase targets, IRF3 and optineurin, and to undergo phosphorylation. They both inhibit binding to optineurin and the p.G217R, within the TBK1 kinase domain, reduces homodimerization, essential for TBK1 activation and function. Finally, we show that the proportion of TBK1 that is active (phosphorylated) is reduced in 5 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients harboring heterozygous missense or in-frame deletion TBK1 mutations. We conclude that missense mutations in functional domains of TBK1 impair the binding and phosphorylation of its normal targets, implicating a common loss of function mechanism, analogous to truncation mutations. Disclosing large-scale directed functional connections in MEG with the multivariate phase slope index Abstract The phase slope index (PSI) is a method to disclose the direction of frequency-specific neural interactions from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) time series. A fundamental property of PSI is that of vanishing for linear mixing of independent neural sources. This property allows PSI to cope with the artificial instantaneous connectivity among MEG sensors or brain sources induced by the field spread. Nevertheless, PSI is limited by being a bivariate estimator of directionality as opposite to the multidimensional nature of brain activity as revealed by MEG. The purpose of this work is to provide a multivariate generalization of PSI. We termed this measure as the multivariate phase slope index (MPSI). In order to test the ability of MPSI in estimating the directionality, and to compare the MPSI results to those obtained by bivariate PSI approaches based on maximizing imaginary part of coherency and on canonical correlation analysis, we used extensive simulations. We proved that MPSI achieves the highest performance and that in a large number of simulated cases, the bivariate methods, as opposed to MPSI, do not detect a statistically significant directionality. Finally, we applied MPSI to assess seed-based directed functional connectivity in the alpha band from resting state MEG data of 61 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The obtained results highlight a directed functional coupling in the alpha band between the primary visual cortex and several key regions of well-known resting state networks, e.g. dorsal attention network and fronto-parietal network. Alpha and alpha-beta phase synchronization mediate the recruitment of the visuospatial attention network through the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus Abstract It is well known that attentional selection of relevant information relies on local synchronization of alpha band neuronal oscillations in visual cortices for inhibition of distracting inputs. Additionally, evidence for long-range coupling of neuronal oscillations between visual cortices and regions engaged in the anticipation of upcoming stimuli has been more recently provided. Nevertheless, on the one hand the relation between long-range functional coupling and anatomical connections is still to be assessed, and, on the other hand, the specific role of the alpha and beta frequency bands in the different processes underlying visuo-spatial attention still needs further clarification. We address these questions using measures of linear (frequency-specific) and nonlinear (cross-frequency) phase-synchronization in a cohort of 28 healthy subjects using magnetoencephalography. We show that alpha band phase-synchronization is modulated by the orienting of attention according to a parieto-occipital top-down mechanism reflecting behavior, and its hemispheric asymmetry is predicted by volume\\'s asymmetry of specific tracts of the Superior-Longitudinal-Fasciculus. We also show that a network comprising parietal regions and the right putative Frontal-Eye-Field, but not the left, is recruited in the deployment of spatial attention through an alpha-beta cross-frequency coupling. Overall, we demonstrate that the visuospatial attention network features subsystems indexed by characteristic spectral fingerprints, playing different functional roles in the anticipation of upcoming stimuli and with diverse relation to fiber tracts. The impact of improved MEG–MRI co-registration on MEG connectivity analysis | openaire: EC/H2020/686865/EU//BREAKBEN Co-registration between structural head images and functional MEG data is needed for anatomically-informed MEG data analysis. Despite the efforts to minimize the co-registration error, conventional landmark- and surface-based strategies for co-registering head and MEG device coordinates achieve an accuracy of typically 5–10 mm. Recent advances in instrumentation and technical solutions, such as the development of hybrid ultra-low-field (ULF)MRI–MEG devices or the use of 3D-printed individualized foam head-casts, promise unprecedented co-registration accuracy, i.e., 2 mm or better. In the present study, we assess through simulations the impact of such an improved co-registration on MEG connectivity analysis. We generated synthetic MEG recordings for pairs of connected cortical sources with variable locations. We then assessed the capability to reconstruct source-level connectivity from these recordings for 0–15-mm co-registration error, three levels of head modeling detail (one-, three- and four-compartment models), two source estimation techniques (linearly constrained minimum-variance beamforming and minimum-norm estimation MNE)and five separate connectivity metrics (imaginary coherency, phase-locking value, amplitude-envelope correlation, phase-slope index and frequency-domain Granger causality). We found that beamforming can better take advantage of an accurate co-registration than MNE. Specifically, when the co-registration error was smaller than 3 mm, the relative error in connectivity estimates was down to one-third of that observed with typical co-registration errors. MNE provided stable results for a wide range of co-registration errors, while the performance of beamforming rapidly degraded as the co-registration error increased. Furthermore, we found that even moderate co-registration errors (>6 mm, on average)essentially decrease the difference of four- and three- or one-compartment models. Hence, a precise co-registration is important if one wants to take full advantage of highly accurate head models for connectivity analysis. We conclude that an improved co-registration will be beneficial for reliable connectivity analysis and effective use of highly accurate head models in future MEG connectivity studies. Peer reviewed Evolution of cerebrospinal fluid total α-synuclein in Parkinson\\'s disease Abstract Introduction Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total α-synuclein is considered a potential biomarker for Parkinson\\'s disease (PD), but little is known about the evolution of this marker during the course of the disease. Our objective was to investigate whether CSF total α-synuclein concentrations change over time and are associated with motor and cognitive function in PD. Methods CSF total α-synuclein concentrations were quantified in 56 longitudinally followed PD patients, 27 of whom provided CSF repeatedly 2 and/or 4 years later. Another 18 subjects were included as controls. The samples were analyzed using two independent, validated ELISA methods: our recently developed and validated in-house ELISA and a commercial kit from BioLegend. Results CSF total α-synuclein levels did not distinguish PD patients from controls, displayed no substantial changes during a period of up to 4 years, and did not predict subsequent motor or cognitive decline. These findings were consistent for both analytical methods. Conclusion Our findings do not support the clinical utility of total α-synuclein as a single diagnostic or prognostic biomarker in PD. Effects of second-generation antipsychotics on human subcutaneous adipose tissue metabolism [Results] Acute treatment with a therapeutic concentration of olanzapine decreases basal lipolysis in isolated adipocytes; this effect was not observed after long-term incubation with the drug. Supra-therapeutic concentration of aripiprazole reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after short- and long-term pre-incubation. Both drugs at supra-therapeutic concentrations downregulated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL1B genes after 72\\u202fh incubation. Similarly, supra-therapeutic concentrations of both drugs and therapeutic concentration of olanzapine, reduced the expression of PPARGC1A, PDK4, and CPT1B genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Neither of the antipsychotics affected the expression of the main adipokines LEP and ADIPOQ, genes involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, LPL and FASN, nor the master adipogenesis regulator, PPARG. Schistosomiasis Control: Leave No Age Group Behind Despite accelerating progress towards schistosomiasis control in sub-Saharan Africa, several age groups have been eclipsed by current treatment and monitoring strategies that mainly focus on school-aged children. As schistosomiasis poses a threat to people of all ages, unfortunate gaps exist in current treatment coverage and associated monitoring efforts, preventing subsequent health benefits to preschool-aged children as well as certain adolescents and adults. Expanding access to younger ages through the forthcoming pediatric praziquantel formulation and improving treatment coverage in older ages is essential. This should occur alongside formal inclusion of these groups in large-scale monitoring and evaluation activities. Current omission of these age groups from treatment and monitoring exacerbates health inequities and has long-term consequences for sustainable schistosomiasis control. European contribution to the study of ROS: A summary of the findings and prospects for the future from the COST action BM1203 (EU-ROS) The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) provides an ideal framework to establish multi-disciplinary research networks. COST Action BM1203 (EU-ROS) represents a consortium of researchers from different disciplines who are dedicated to providing new insights and tools for better understanding redox biology and medicine and, in the long run, to finding new therapeutic strategies to target dysregulated redox processes in various diseases. This report highlights the major achievements of EU-ROS as well as research updates and new perspectives arising from its members. The EU-ROS consortium comprised more than 140 active members who worked together for four years on the topics briefly described below. The formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) is an established hallmark of our aerobic environment and metabolism but RONS also act as messengers via redox regulation of essential cellular processes. The fact that many diseases have been found to be associated with oxidative stress established the theory of oxidative stress as a trigger of diseases that can be corrected by antioxidant therapy. However, while experimental studies support this thesis, clinical studies still generate controversial results, due to complex pathophysiology of oxidative stress in humans. For future improvement of antioxidant therapy and better understanding of redox-associated disease progression detailed knowledge on the sources and targets of RONS formation and discrimination of their detrimental or beneficial roles is required. In order to advance this important area of biology and medicine, highly synergistic approaches combining a variety of diverse and contrasting disciplines are needed. Protection against gamma-radiation injury by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, in particular in immune cells, and plays a pleiotropic role in dephosphorylating many substrates. Moreover, PTP1B expression is enhanced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and to different cell stressors. Taking advantage of the use of mice deficient in PTP1B we have investigated the effect of γ-radiation in these animals and found enhanced lethality and decreased respiratory exchange ratio vs. the corresponding wild type animals. Using bone-marrow derived macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type and PTP1B-deficient mice, we observed a differential response to various cell stressors. PTP1B-deficient macrophages exhibited an enhanced response to γ-radiation, UV-light, LPS and S-nitroso-glutathione. Macrophages exposed to γ-radiation show DNA damage and fragmentation, increased ROS production, a lack in GSH elevation and enhanced acidic β-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, these differences were not observed in MEFs. Differential gene expression analysis of WT and KO macrophages revealed that the main pathways affected after irradiation were an up-regulation of protein secretion, TGF-β signaling and angiogenesis among other, and downregulation of Myc targets and Hedgehog signaling. These results demonstrate a key role for PTP1B in the protection against the cytotoxicity of irradiation in intact animal and in macrophages, which might be therapeutically relevant. PARP1 promoter links cell cycle progression with adaptation to oxidative environment Although electrophiles are considered as detrimental to cells, accumulating recent evidence indicates that proliferating non-cancerous and particularly cancerous cells utilize these agents for pro-survival and cell cycle promoting signaling. Hence, the redox shift to mild oxidant release must be balanced by multiple defense mechanisms. Our latest findings demonstrate that cell cycle progression, which dictates oxidant level in stress-free conditions, determines PARP1 transcription. Growth modulating factors regulate CDK4/6-RBs-E2Fs axis. In cells arrested in G1 and G0, RB1-E2F1 and RBL2-E2F4 dimers recruit chromatin remodelers such as HDAC1, SWI/SNF and PRC2 to condense chromatin and turn off transcription. Release of retinoblastoma-based repressive complexes from E2F-dependent gene promoters in response to cell transition to S phase enables transcription of PARP1. This enzyme contributes to repair of oxidative DNA damage by supporting several strand break repair pathways and nucleotide or base excision repair pathways, as well as acting as a co-activator of transcription factors such as NRF2 and HIF1a, which control expression of antioxidant enzymes involved in removal of electrophiles and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, PARP1 is indispensible for transcription of the pro-survival kinases MAP2K6, ERK1/2 and AKT1, and for maintaining MAPK activity by suppressing transcription of the MAPK inhibitor, MPK1. In summary, cell cycle controlled PARP1 transcription helps cells to adapt to a pro-oxidant redox shift. Lipoproteins as targets and markers of lipoxidation Lipoproteins are essential systemic lipid transport particles, composed of apolipoproteins embedded in a phospholipid and cholesterol monolayer surrounding a cargo of diverse lipid species. Many of the lipids present are susceptible to oxidative damage by lipid peroxidation, giving rise to the formation of reactive lipid peroxidation products (rLPPs). In view of the close proximity of the protein and lipid moieties within lipoproteins, the probability of adduct formation between rLPPs and amino acid residues of the proteins, a process called lipoxidation, is high. There has been interest for many years in the biological effects of such modifications, but the field has been limited to some extent by the availability of methods to determine the sites and exact nature of such modification. More recently, the availability of a wide range of antibodies to lipoxidation products, as well as advances in analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS), have increased our knowledge substantially. While most work has focused on LDL, oxidation of which has long been associated with pro-inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis, some studies on HDL, VLDL and Lipoprotein(a) have also been reported. As the broader topic of LDL oxidation has been reviewed previously, this review focuses on lipoxidative modifications of lipoproteins, from the historical background through to recent advances in the field. We consider the main methods of analysis for detecting rLPP adducts on apolipoproteins, including their advantages and disadvantages, as well as the biological effects of lipoxidized lipoproteins and their potential roles in diseases. Advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) as RAGE binders: Mass spectrometric and computational studies to explain the reasons why Advanced Lipoxidation End-products (ALEs) are modified proteins that can act as pathogenic factors in several chronic diseases. Several molecular mechanisms have so far been considered to explain the damaging action of ALEs and among these a pathway involving the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) should be considered. The aim of the present work is to understand if ALEs formed from lipid peroxidation derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS) are able to act as RAGE binders and also to gain a deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the protein-protein engagement. ALEs were produced in vitro, by incubating human serum albumin (HSA) with 4-hydroxy-trans−\\u202f2-nonenal (HNE), acrolein (ACR) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The identification of ALEs was performed by MS. ALEs were then subjected to the VC1 Pull-Down assay (VC1 is the ligand binding domain of RAGE) and the enrichment factor (the difference between the relative abundance in the enriched sample minus the amount in the untreated one) as an index of affinity, was determined. Computation studies were then carried out to explain the factors governing the affinity of the adducted moieties and the site of interaction on adducted HSA for VC1-binding. The in silico analyses revealed the key role played by those adducts which strongly reduce the basicity of the modified residues and thus occur at their neutral state at physiological conditions (e.g. the MDA adducts, dihydropyridine-Lysine (DHPK) and N-2-pyrimidyl-ornithine (NPO), and acrolein derivatives, N-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydro-piperidinyl) lysine, FDPK). These neutral adducts become unable to stabilize ion-pairs with the surrounding negative residues which thus can contact the RAGE positive residues. In conclusion, ALEs derived from lipid peroxidation-RCS are binders of RAGE and this affinity depends on the effect of the adduct moiety to reduce the basicity of the target amino acid and on the acid moieties surrounding the aminoacidic target. Vimentin disruption by lipoxidation and electrophiles: Role of the cysteine residue and filament dynamics The intermediate filament protein vimentin constitutes a critical sensor for electrophilic and oxidative stress, which induce extensive reorganization of the vimentin cytoskeletal network. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying these effects. In vitro, electrophilic lipids, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), directly bind to vimentin, whereas the oxidant diamide induces disulfide bond formation. Mutation of the single vimentin cysteine residue (Cys328) blunts disulfide formation and reduces lipoxidation by 15d-PGJ2, but not HNE. Preincubation with these agents differentially hinders NaClinduced filament formation by wild-type vimentin, with effects ranging from delayed elongation and increased filament diameter to severe impairment of assembly or aggregation. Conversely, the morphology of vimentin Cys328Ser filaments is mildly or not affected. Interestingly, preformed vimentin filaments are more resistant to electrophile-induced disruption, although chemical modification is not diminished, showing that vimentin (lip) oxidation prior to assembly is more deleterious. In cells, electrophiles, particularly diamide, induce a fast and drastic disruption of existing filaments, which requires the presence of Cys328. As the cellular vimentin network is under continuous remodeling, we hypothesized that vimentin exchange on filaments would be necessary for diamide-induced disruption. We confirmed that strategies reducing vimentin dynamics, as monitored by FRAP, including cysteine crosslinking and ATP synthesis inhibition, prevent diamide effect. In turn, phosphorylation may promote vimentin disassembly. Indeed, treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to prevent dephosphorylation intensifies electrophile-induced wild-type vimentin filament disruption. However, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient vimentin mutant is only partially protected from disorganization, Cys328Ser vimentin is virtually resistant, even in the presence of calyculin A. Together, these results indicate that modification of Cys328 and vimentin exchange are critical for electrophile-induced network disruption. Lipoxidation and cancer immunity Lipoxidation is a well-known reaction between electrophilic carbonyl species, formed during oxidation of lipids, and specific proteins that, in most cases, causes an alteration in proteins function. This can occur under physiological conditions but, in many cases, it has been associated to pathological process, including cancer. Lipoxidation may have an effect in cancer development through their effects in tumour cells, as well as through the alteration of immune components and the consequent modulation of the immune response. The formation of protein adducts affects different proteins in cancer, triggering different mechanism, such as proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis, among others, altering cancer progression. The divergent results obtained documented that the formation of lipoxidation adducts can have either anti-carcinogenic or pro-carcinogenic effects, depending on the cell type affected and the specific adduct formed. Moreover, lipoxidation adducts may alter the immune response, consequently causing either positive or negative alterations in cancer progression. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of lipoxidation adducts in cancer cells and immune components and their consequences in the evolution of different types of cancer. Discovery of bioactive nitrated lipids and nitro-lipid-protein adducts using mass spectrometry-based approaches Nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FA) undergo reversible Michael adduction reactions with cysteine and histidine residues leading to the post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins. This electrophilic character of NO2-FA is strictly related to their biological roles. The NO2-FA-induced PTM of signaling proteins can lead to modifications in protein structure, function, and subcellular localization. The nitro lipid-protein adducts trigger a series of downstream signaling events that culminates with anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and cytoprotective effects mediated by NO2-FA. These lipoxidation adducts have been detected and characterized both in model systems and in biological samples by using mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches. These MS approaches allow to unequivocally identify the adduct together with the targeted residue of modification. The identification of the modified proteins allows inferring on the possible impact of the NO2-FA-induced modification. This review will focus on MS-based approaches as valuable tools to identify NO2-FA-protein adducts and to unveil the biological effect of this lipoxidation adducts. Lipoxidation in cardiovascular diseases Lipids can go through lipid peroxidation, an endogenous chain reaction that consists in the oxidative degradation of lipids leading to the generation of a wide variety of highly reactive carbonyl species (RCS), such as short-chain carbonyl derivatives and oxidized truncated phospholipids. RCS exert a wide range of biological effects due to their ability to interact and covalently bind to nucleophilic groups on other macromolecules, such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, and proteins, forming reversible and/or irreversible modifications and generating the so-called advanced lipoxidation end-products (ALEs). Lipoxidation plays a relevant role in the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly in the atherosclerosis-based diseases in which oxidized lipids and their adducts have been extensively characterized and associated with several processes responsible for the onset and development of atherosclerosis, such as endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Herein we will review the current knowledge on the sources of lipids that undergo oxidation in the context of cardiovascular diseases, both from the bloodstream and tissues, and the methods for detection, characterization, and quantitation of their oxidative products and protein adducts. Moreover, lipoxidation and ALEs have been associated with many oxidative-based diseases, including CVD, not only as potential biomarkers but also as therapeutic targets. Indeed, several therapeutic strategies, acting at different levels of the ALEs cascade, have been proposed, essentially blocking ALEs formation, but also their catabolism or the resulting biological responses they induce. However, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of formation and targets of ALEs could expand the available therapeutic strategies. Impact of inhibition of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway on biomolecules carbonylation and proteome regulation in rat cardiac cells Cells employ multiple defence mechanisms to sustain a wide range of stress conditions associated with accumulation of modified self-biomolecules leading to lipo- and proteotoxicity. One of such mechanisms involves activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway for removal and degradation of modified lipids, proteins and even organelles. Biomolecules carbonylation, an irreversible oxidative modification, occurs in a variety of pathological conditions and is generally viewed as a marker of oxidative stress. Here, we used a model of rat primary cardiac cells to elucidate the role of autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the turnover of carbonylated biomolecules. Cells treated with inhibitors of autophagy-lysosomal degradation and primed with a short pulse of mild nitroxidative stress were studied using fluorescent microscopy and accumulation of carbonylated biomolecules in droplets- or vesicle-like structures was observed. Furthermore, systems-wide analysis of proteome regulation using relative label free quantification approach revealed the most significant alterations in cells treated with protease inhibitors. Interestingly, down-regulation of insulin signalling was among the most enriched pathway, as revealed by functional annotation of regulated proteins.

An integrated transport mechanism of the maltose ABC importer International audience; ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport a large diversity of molecules actively across biological membranes. A combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies has established the maltose transporter MalFGK 2 as one of the best characterized proteins of the ABC family. MalF and MalG are the transmembrane domains, and two MalKs form a homodimer of nucleotide-binding domains. A periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MalE) delivers maltose and other maltodextrins to the transporter, and triggers its ATPase activity. Substrate import occurs in a unidi-rectional manner by ATP-driven conformational changes in MalK 2 that allow alternating access of the substrate-binding site in MalF to each side of the membrane. In this review, we present an integrated molecular mechanism of the transport process considering all currently available information. Furthermore , we summarize remaining inconsistencies and outline possible future routes to decipher the full mechanistic details of transport by MalEFGK 2 complex and that of related importer systems. The transition of energy intensive processing industries towards deep decarbonization: Characteristics and implications for future research Abstract Energy-intensive processing industries (EPIs) produce iron and steel, aluminum, chemicals, cement, glass, and paper and pulp and are responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions. To meet 2050 emission targets, an accelerated transition towards deep decarbonization is required in these industries. Insights from sociotechnical and innovation systems perspectives are needed to better understand how to steer and facilitate this transition process. The transitions literature has so far, however, not featured EPIs. This paper positions EPIs within the transitions literature by characterizing their sociotechnical and innovation systems in terms of industry structure, innovation strategies, networks, markets and governmental interventions. We subsequently explore how these characteristics may influence the transition to deep decarbonization and identify gaps in the literature from which we formulate an agenda for further transitions research on EPIs and consider policy implications. Furthering this research field would not only enrich discussions on policy for achieving deep decarbonization, but would also develop transitions theory since the distinctive EPI characteristics are likely to yield new patterns in transition dynamics. Simulations meet machine learning in structural biology Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be able to reach sampling in the second timescale within five years, producing petabytes of simulation data at current force field accuracy. Notwithstanding this, MD will still be in the regime of low-throughput, high-latency predictions with average accuracy. We envisage that machine learning (ML) will be able to solve both the accuracy and time-to-prediction problem by learning predictive models using expensive simulation data. The synergies between classical, quantum simulations and ML methods, such as artificial neural networks, have the potential to drastically reshape the way we make predictions in computational structural biology and drug discovery. Computational prediction of GPCR oligomerization There has been a recent and prolific expansion in the number of GPCR crystal structures being solved: in both active and inactive forms and in complex with ligand, with G protein and with each other. Despite this, there is relatively little experimental information about the precise configuration of GPCR oligomers during these different biologically relevant states. While it may be possible to identify the experimental conditions necessary to crystallize a GPCR preferentially in a specific structural conformation, computational approaches afford a potentially more tractable means of describing the probability of formation of receptor dimers and higher order oligomers. Ensemble-based computational methods based on structurally determined dimers, coupled with a computational workflow that uses quantum mechanical methods to analyze the chemical nature of the molecular interactions at a GPCR dimer interface, will generate the reproducible and accurate predictions needed to predict previously unidentified GPCR dimers and to inform future advances in our ability to understand and begin to precisely manipulate GPCR oligomers in biological systems. It may also provide information needed to achieve an increase in the number of experimentally determined oligomeric GPCR structures. Range shifts of native and invasive trees exacerbate the impact of climate change on epiphyte distribution: The case of lung lichen and black locust in Italy International audience; While changing climatic conditions may directly impact species distribution ranges, indirect effects related to altered biotic interactions may exacerbate range shifts. This situation fully applies to epiphytic lichens that are sensitive to climatic factors and strongly depend on substrate occurrence and features for their dispersal and establishment. In this work, we modelled the climatic suitability across Italy under current and future climate of the forest species Lobaria pulmonaria, the lung lichen. Comparatively, we modelled the suitability of its main tree species in Italy, as well as that of the alien tree Robinia pseudoacacia, black locust, whose spread may cause the decline of many forest lichen species. Our results support the view that climate change may cause range shifts ofepiphytes by altering the spatial pattern of their climatic suitability (direct effect) and simultaneously causing range shifts of their host-tree species (indirect effect). This phenomenon seems to be emphasized by the invasion of alien trees, as in the case of black locust, that may replace native host tree species. Results indicate that a reduction of the habitat suitability of the lung lichen across Italy should be expected in the face of climate change and that this is coupled with aloss of suitable substrate. This situation seems to be determined by two main processes that act simultaneously: 1) a partial reduction of the spatial overlap between the climatic niche of the lung lichen and that of its host tree species, and 2) the invasion of native woods by black locust. The case of lung lichen and black locust in Italy highlights that epiphytes are prone to both direct and indirect effects of climate change. The invasion of alien trees may have consequences that are still poorly evaluated for epiphytes. Correlates of vaccine-induced protective immunity against Ebola virus disease Ebola virus disease is a deadly infection which occurs in sporadic outbreaks. Several vaccine candidates have been developed. The most advanced candidate is the recombinant VSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, in which the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) envelope glycoprotein is replaced by the Zaire strain Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP). This vaccine demonstrated 100% protection in a ring vaccination trial performed in Guinea in 2015, was granted \"Breakthrough Therapy Designation\" by the FDA and PRIority Medicines (PRIME), and is currently (June 2018) used to support outbreak control in Democratic Republic of Congo. rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP elicits a strong and durable antibody response in most vaccinees. This sustained Ebola GP-specific antibody response correlates with an early activation of innate immunity, especially of monocytes and of type-I interferon induced genes. Despite significant progress in the characterization of vaccine-induced immunity, human correlates of protection against Ebolavirus infection have not yet been fully established. A systems biology approach, integrating clinical, immunological, transcriptomic and metabolomic data from pre-clinical and clinical vaccine studies, together with data from disease survivors, will be instrumental to identify Ebola vaccine correlates of protection. The information generated for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine may also help identify the correlates of protection of the other Ebola vaccine candidates. Simultaneous determination of six antipsychotics, two of their metabolites and caffeine in human plasma by LC-MS/MS using a phospholipid-removal microelution-solid phase extraction method for sample preparation A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated in human plasma for the simultaneous determination of aripiprazole (ARI) and its metabolite dehydro-aripiprazole (DARI); olanzapine (OLA), risperidone (RIS), paliperidone (PAL), quetiapine (QUE), clozapine (CLO) and caffeine (CAF). CAF is included to the method because it can have an influence on drug metabolism due to competitive inhibition. The above mentioned compounds and their isotope-labeled internal standards were extracted from 200\\u202fµL human plasma samples by both, effective phospholipids-eliminating three-step microelution-solid-phase extraction (µ-SPE) and protein precipitation (PPT) for comparison. A combination of formic acid (0.2%)-acetonitrile (pH 3.0; 65:35, v/v) was used as mobile phase and the chromatogram was run under gradient conditions at a flow rate of 0.6\\u202fmL/min. Run time lasted 6\\u202fmin, followed by a re-equilibration time of 3\\u202fmin. All analytes were monitored by mass spectrometric detection operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode and the method was validated covering the corresponding therapeutic ranges: 0.18–120\\u202fng/mL for ARI, 0.25–80\\u202fng/mL for DARI, 1.00–100\\u202fng/mL for OLA, 0.70–60\\u202fng/mL for RIS, 0.20–30\\u202fng/mL for PAL, 0.50–160\\u202fng/mL for QUE, 0.50–1000\\u202fng/mL for CLO, and finally 1200–3700\\u202fng/mL for CAF. The method was validated based on the recommendations of regulatory agencies through tests of precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, identity confirmation, trueness, matrix effect, process efficiency, stability, selectivity, linearity and carry-over effect fulfilling the guideline requirements. Our µ-SPE method results in the elimination of more than 99% of early eluting and more than 92% of late-eluting phospholipids compared to PPT. Additionally, the method was successfully applied for quantifying ARI and OLA plasma concentrations from healthy volunteers. Impact of Membrane Drug Transporters on Resistance to Small-Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Small-molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (TKIs) are the mainstay of treatment for many malignancies and represent novel treatment options for other diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Twenty-five TKIs are currently FDA-approved and >130 are being evaluated in clinical trials. Increasing evidence suggests that drug exposure of TKIs may significantly contribute to drug resistance, independently from somatic variation of TKI target genes. Membrane transport proteins may limit the amount of TKI reaching the target cells. This review highlights current knowledge on the basic and clinical pharmacology of membrane transporters involved in TKI disposition and their contribution to drug efficacy and adverse drug effects. In addition to non-genetic and epigenetic factors, genetic variants, particularly rare ones, in transporter genes are promising novel factors to explain interindividual variability in the response to TKI therapy. Pitfalls and Opportunities for Epigenomic Analyses Focused on Disease Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapy Trends Many studies assess epigenetic signatures in bodily fluids and make conclusions about epigenetic patterns in inaccessible tissues of interest such as brain, thus neglecting the tissue specificity of epigenetic marks. There is a growing lag between the forefront of epigenetics and the methods routinely applied in epigenetic studies. For instance, while techniques to detect the functionally relevant methylcytosine derivate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine were described years ago, only a few studies use such detection methods. Lipidomes in health and disease: Analytical strategies and considerations Lipidomics is a rapidly-growing field which focuses on global characterization of lipids at molecular and systems levels. As small changes in the concentrations of lipids may have important physiological consequences, much attention in the field has recently been paid to more accurate quantitation and identification of lipids. Community-wide efforts have been initiated, aiming to develop best practices for lipidomic analyses and reporting of lipidomic data. Nevertheless, current approaches for comprehensive analysis of lipidomes have some inherent challenges and limitations. Additionally, there is, currently, limited knowledge concerning the impacts of various external and internal exposures on lipid levels. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in lipidomics analysis, with a primary focus on analytical approaches, as well as on the different sources of variation in quantifying lipid levels, both technical and biological. Applying label-free dynamic mass redistribution assay for studying endogenous FPR1 receptor signalling in human neutrophils Abstract Introduction The label-free dynamic mass redistribution-based assay (DMR) is a powerful method for studying signalling pathways of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Herein we present the label-free DMR assay as a robust readout for pharmacological characterization of formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) in human neutrophils. Methods Neutrophils were isolated from fresh human blood and their responses to FPR1 and FPR2 agonists, i.e. compound 43, fMLF and WKYMVm were measured in a label-free DMR assay using Epic Benchtop System from Corning®. Obtained DMR traces were used to calculate agonist potencies. Results The potencies (pEC 50 ) of fMLF, WKYMVm and compound 43, determined on human neutrophils using the label-free DMR assay were 8.63, 7.76 and 5.92, respectively. The DMR response to fMLF, but not WKYMVm and compound 43 could be blocked by the FPR1-specific antagonist cyclosporin H. Discussion We conclude that the DMR assay can be used, and complements more traditional methods, to study the signalling and pharmacology of endogenous FPR receptors in human neutrophils. The structural proteins of epidemic and historical strains of Zika virus differ in their ability to initiate viral infection in human host cells International audience; Mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged in South Pacific islands and Americas where large epidemics were documented. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of the structural proteins C, prM and E in the permissiveness of human host cells to epidemic strains of ZIKV. To this end, we evaluated the capacity of the epidemic strain BeH819015 to infect epithelial A549 and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells in comparison to the African historical MR766 strain. For that purpose, we generated a molecular clone of BeH819015 and a chimeric clone of MR766 which contains the BeH819015 structural protein region. We showed that ZIKV containing BeH819015 structural proteins was much less efficient in cell-attachment leading to a reduced susceptibility of A549 and SH-SY5Y cells to viral infection. Our data illustrate a previously underrated role for C, prM, and E in ZIKV epidemic strain ability to initiate viral infection in human host cells. Experiment design of the International CLIVAR C20C+ Detection and Attribution project There is a growing research interest in understanding extreme weather in the context of anthropogenic climate change, posing a requirement for new tailored climate data products. Here we introduce the Climate of the 20th Century Plus Detection and Attribution project (C20C\\xa0+\\xa0D&A), an international collaboration generating a product specifically intended for diagnosing causes of changes in extreme weather and for understanding uncertainties in that diagnosis. The project runs multiple dynamical models of the atmosphere-land system under observed historical conditions as well as under naturalised versions of those observed conditions, with the latter representing how the climate system might have evolved in the absence of anthropogenic interference. Each model generates large ensembles of simulations with different initial conditions for each historical scenario, providing a large sample size for understanding interannual variability, long-term trends, and the anthropogenic role in rare types of weather. This paper describes the C20C\\xa0+\\xa0D&A project design, implementation, strengths, and limitations, and also discusses various activities such as this special issue of Weather and Climate Extremes dedicated to “First results of the C20C\\xa0+\\xa0Detection and Attribution project”. Keywords: Detection and attribution, Event attribution, Climate models Saharan air intrusions as a relevant mechanism for Iberian heatwaves: The record breaking events of August 2018 and June 2019 The summers of 2018 and 2019 were characterized by unusually warm conditions over Europe. Here, we describe the intense heatwaves striking the Iberian Peninsula in early August 2018 and late June 2019. The 2018 episode was relatively short-lived but outstanding in amplitude, particularly in western Iberia. Similar to previous mega-heatwaves, the 2019 event was long-lasting and affected large areas of western and central Europe, including eastern Iberia. During these events, many absolute temperature records were broken in western and eastern Iberia, respectively (some of them standing since 2003). In both cases, a cyclonic circulation off the coast in the northeastern Atlantic and a strong subtropical ridge pattern over the affected area promoted the advection of an anomalously warm air mass. This paper highlights the role of these very warm, stable and dry air intrusions of Saharan origin in the western and eastern Iberia heatwave events. Using a thermodynamical classification based on the geopotential height thickness and potential temperature, we show how the magnitude and poleward extension of these Saharan intrusions were unprecedented in the period since 1948. The relationship between Iberian heatwaves and Saharan warm air intrusions is discussed in the long-term context, showing a closer link in southern sectors of the Peninsula. However, a consistent poleward trend in the latitudinal extension of these subtropical intrusions reveals their increasing relevance for heatwaves in northern sectors of Iberia and western Europe. This overall trend is accompanied by an apparent “see-saw” in the occurrence of subtropical intrusions between eastern and western Iberia on multi-decadal scales. The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy Summary Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the USA and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient\\'s community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy. Soil-transmitted helminth infections Summary More than a quarter of the world\\'s population is at risk of infection with the soil-transmitted helminths Ascaris lumbricoides , hookworm ( Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus ), Trichuris trichiura , and Strongyloides stercoralis . Infected children and adults present with a range of medical and surgical conditions, and clinicians should consider the possibility of infection in individuals living in, or returning from, endemic regions. Although safe and effective drugs are donated free to endemic countries, only half of at-risk children received treatment in 2016. This Seminar describes the epidemiology, lifecycles, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, management, and public health control of soil-transmitted helminths. Previous work has questioned the effect of population-level deworming; however, it remains beyond doubt that treatment reduces the severe consequences of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. We highlight the need for refined diagnostic tools and effective control options to scale up public health interventions and improve clinical detection and management of these infections. Safety and immunogenicity of the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP Ebola virus vaccine candidate in healthy adults: a phase 1b randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study Summary Background The 2014 Zaire Ebola virus outbreak highlighted the need for a safe, effective vaccine with a rapid onset of protection. We report the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP) across a 6 log 10 dose range in two sequential cohorts. Methods In this phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study we enrolled and randomly assigned healthy adults (aged 18–61 years) at eight study sites in the USA to receive a single injection of vaccine or placebo, administered by intramuscular injection. In cohort 1, participants were assigned to receive 3\\u2008×\\u200810 3 , 3\\u2008×\\u200810 4 , 3\\u2008×\\u200810 5 , or 3\\u2008×\\u200810 6 PFU doses of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP or placebo. In cohort 2, participants were assigned to receive 3\\u2008×\\u200810 6 , 9\\u2008×\\u200810 6 , 2\\u2008×\\u200810 7 , or 1\\u2008×\\u200810 8 PFU doses of rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP or placebo. Participants were centrally allocated by the study statistician to vaccine groups or placebo through computer-generated randomisation lists. The primary safety outcome was incidence of adverse events within 14 days in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants who received vaccine or placebo), and the primary outcome for immunogenicity was IgG ELISA antibody titres at day 28 in the per-protocol population. Surveillance was enhanced for arthritis and dermatitis through to day 56. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02314923. Findings Between Dec 26, 2014, and June 8, 2015, 513 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned; one was not immunised because of unsuccessful phlebotomy. In cohort 1, 256 participants received vaccine (3\\u2008×\\u200810 3 [n=64], 3\\u2008×\\u200810 4 [n=64], 3\\u2008×\\u200810 5 [n=64], or 3\\u2008×\\u200810 6 PFU [n=64]) and 74 received placebo. In cohort 2, 162 participants received vaccine (3\\u2008×\\u200810 6 [n=20], 9\\u2008×\\u200810 6 [n=47], 2\\u2008×\\u200810 7 [n=47], or 1\\u2008×\\u200810 8 PFU [n=48]) and 20 received placebo. Most adverse events occurred in the first day after vaccination, and were mild to moderate in intensity, of a short duration, and more frequent at high vaccine doses (9\\u2008×\\u200810 6 PFU and greater). At the 2\\u2008×\\u200810 7 PFU dose (used in phase 3 trials), the most common local adverse events versus placebo within the first 14 days were arm pain (57·4% [27 of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]) and local tenderness (59·6% [28 of 47] vs 8·5% [eight of 94]). The most common systemic adverse events at the 2\\u2008×\\u200810 7 PFU dose versus placebo, occurring in the first 14 days, were headache (46·8% [22 of 47] vs 27·7% [26 of 94]), fatigue (38·3% [18 of 47] vs 19·1% [18 of 94]), myalgia (34·0% [16 of 47] vs 10·6% [10 of 94]), subjective fever (29·8% [14 of 47] vs 2·1% [two of 94]), shivering or chills (27·7% [13 of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]), sweats (23·4% [11 of 47] vs 3·2% [three of 94]), joint aches and pain (19·1% [nine of 47] vs 7·4% [seven of 94]), objective fever (14·9% [seven of 47] vs 1·1% [one of 94]), and joint tenderness or swelling (14·9% [seven of 47] vs 2·1% [two of 94]). Self-limited, post-vaccination arthritis occurred in 4·5% (19 of 418) of vaccinees (median onset 12·0 days [IQR 10–14]; median duration 8·0 days [6–15]) versus 3·2% (three of 94) of controls (median onset 15·0 days [6–20]; median duration 47·0 days [37–339]), with no apparent dose relationship. Post-vaccination dermatitis occurred in 5·7% (24 of 418) of vaccinees (median onset 9·0 days [IQR 2–12]; median duration 7·0 days [4–9]) versus 3·2% (three of 94) of controls (median onset 5·0 days [3–53]; median duration 33·0 days [5–370]). A low-level, transient, dose-dependent viraemia occurred in concert with early reactogenicity. Antibody responses were observed in most participants by day 14. IgG and neutralising antibody titres were dose-related (p=0·0003 for IgG ELISA and p 7 PFU dose, the geometric mean IgG ELISA endpoint titre was 1624 (95% CI 1146–2302) and seroconversion was 95·7% (95% CI 85·5–98·8); the geometric mean neutralising antibody titre by PRNT60 was 250 (176–355) and seroconversion was 95·7% (85·5–98·8). These robust immunological responses were sustained for 1 year. Interpretation rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP was well tolerated and stimulated a rapid onset of binding and neutralising antibodies, which were maintained through to day 360. The immunogenicity results support selection of the 2\\u2008×\\u200810 7 PFU dose. Funding Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, US Department of Health and Human Services. Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study Summary Background Evidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men. Methods This prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures. Findings 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25–44) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119\\u2008×\\u200810 6 spermatozoa (IQR 22–234) at day 7 to 45·2\\u2008×\\u200810 6 (16·5–89·6) at day 30 and 70 × 10 6 (28·5–81·4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93·5 pg/mL (IQR 55–162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78–209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in three of 14 patients at day 7, four of 15 at day 11, and four of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and three patients remained positive at day 120. Interpretation Semen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up. Funding Agence de la Biomedecine/Agence Regionale de Sante de la Guadeloupe/Inserm-REACTing. Determinants of antibody persistence across doses and continents after single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination for Ebola virus disease: an observational cohort study Background The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein is efficacious in the weeks following single-dose injection, but duration of immunity is unknown. We aimed to assess antibody persistence at 1 and 2 years in volunteers who received single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV in three previous trials. Methods In this observational cohort study, we prospectively followed-up participants from the African and European phase 1 rVSV-ZEBOV trials, who were vaccinated once in 2014–15 with 300\\u2008000 (low dose) or 10–50 million (high dose) plaque-forming units (pfu) of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to assess ZEBOV glycoprotein (IgG) antibody persistence. The primary outcome was ZEBOV glycoprotein-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) measured yearly by ELISA compared with 1 month (ie, 28 days) after immunisation. We report GMCs up to 2 years (Geneva, Switzerland, including neutralising antibodies up to 6 months) and 1 year (Lambaréné, Gabon; Kilifi, Kenya) after vaccination and factors associated with higher antibody persistence beyond 6 months, according to multivariable analyses. Trials and the observational study were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Geneva: NCT02287480 and NCT02933931; Kilifi: NCT02296983) and the Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry (Lambaréné PACTR201411000919191). Findings Of 217 vaccinees from the original studies (102 from the Geneva study, 75 from the Lambaréné study, and 40 from the Kilifi study), 197 returned and provided samples at 1 year (95 from the Geneva study, 63 from the Lambaréné, and 39 from the Kilifi study) and 90 at 2 years (all from the Geneva study). In the Geneva group, 44 (100%) of 44 participants who had been given a high dose (ie, 10–50 million pfu) of vaccine and who were seropositive at day 28 remained seropositive at 2 years, whereas 33 (89%) of 37 who had been given the low dose (ie, 300\\u2008000 pfu) remained seropositive for 2 years (p=0·042). In participants who had received a high dose, ZEBOV glycoprotein IgG GMCs decreased significantly between their peak (at 1–3 months) and month 6 after vaccination in Geneva (p<0·0001) and Lambaréné (p=0·0298) but not in Kilifi (p=0·5833) and subsequently remained stable at all sites apart from Geneva, where GMC in those given a high dose of vaccine increased significantly between 6 months and 1 year (p=0·0264). Antibody persistence was similar at 1 year and at 6 months in those who had received a low dose of vaccine, with lower titres among participants from the Geneva study at 2 years than at 1 year after vaccination (GMC ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·49–0·77; p<0·0001). In multivariable analyses, predictors of increased IgG GMCs beyond 6 months included high-dose versus low-dose vaccination (Geneva p=0·0133; Lambaréné p=0·008) and vaccine-related arthritis (p=0·0176), but not sex, age, or baseline seropositivity (all p>0·05). Neutralising antibodies seem to be less durable, with seropositivity dropping from 64–71% at 28 days to 27–31% at 6 months in participants from the Geneva study. Interpretation Antibody responses to single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination are sustained across dose ranges and settings, a key criterion in countries where booster vaccinations would be impractical. Familiar barriers still unresolved—a perspective on the Zika virus outbreak research response Summary Research is an important component of an effective response to the increasing frequency of widespread infectious disease outbreaks. In turn, the ability to do such studies relies on willingness of partners in different regions to collaborate and the capacity to mount a rapid research response. The EU-funded ZIKAlliance Consortium has initiated a multicountry epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory research agenda to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Zika virus infection in pregnant women and their children. We reviewed the timeline of patient cohort initiation in relation to the Zika virus epidemic and mapped key events regarding funding, regulatory approvals, and site preparation during this timeline. We then assessed barriers and delays that the international research team experienced through a systematic telephone interview. We have identified three major bottlenecks in the implementation of a swift response: the absence of a timeline for the funding process, delays in regulatory and ethical approval, and the challenging logistics of laboratory support, including diagnostics. These bottlenecks illustrate the clear and urgent need for implementing a strong and permanent global emerging infectious diseases research capacity that has structured funding, enables long-term partnerships, and develops basic clinical and laboratorial research and a response infrastructure that is ready to deploy. CSF and blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis Abstract: Background Alzheimer\\'s disease biomarkers areimportant for early diagnosis in routine clinical practice and research. Three core CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease (A beta 42, T-tau, and P-tau) have been assessed in numerous studies, and several other Alzheimer\\'s disease markers are emerging in the literature. However, there have been no comprehensive meta-analyses of their diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed the literature for 15 biomarkers in both CSF and blood to assess which of these were most altered in Alzheimer\\'s disease. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 2014, about CSF and blood biomarkers reflecting neurodegeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSF, VLP-1, and HFABP), APP metabolism (A beta 42, A beta 40, A beta 38, sAPP alpha, and sAPP beta), tangle pathology (P-tau), blood-brain-barrier function (albumin ratio), and glial activation (YKL-40, MCP-1, and GFAP). Data were taken from cross-sectional cohort studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with Alzheimer\\'s disease and a control cohort, or a cohort with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\\'s disease and a stable mild cognitive impairment cohort. Data were extracted by ten authors and checked by two for accuracy. For quality assessment, modified QUADAS criteria were used. Biomarker performance was rated by random-effects meta-analysis based on the ratio between biomarker concentration in patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease and controls (fold change) or the ratio between biomarker concentration in those with mild cognitive impariment due to Alzheimer\\'s disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment who had a follow-up time of at least 2 years and no further cognitive decline. Findings Of 4521 records identified from PubMed and 624 from Web of Science, 231 articles comprising 15 699 patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease and 13 18 controls were included in this analysis. The core biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer\\'s disease from controls with good performance: CSF T-tau (average ratio 2.54, 95% CI 2-44-2. 64, p<0.0001), P-tau (1.88, 1. 79-1. 97, p<0.0001), and A beta 42 (0.56, 0.55-0.58, p<0.0001). Differentiation between cohorts with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\\'s disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment was also strong (average ratio 0.67 for CSF A beta 42, 1.72 for P-tau, and 1.76 for T-tau). Furthermore, CSF NFL (2.35, 1. 90-2. 91, p<0.0001) and plasma T-tau (1.95, 1.12-3.38, p=0.02) had large effect sizes when differentiating between controls and patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease, whereas those of CSF NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderate (average ratios 1.28-1.47). Other assessed biomarkers had only marginal effect sizes or did not differentiate between control and patient samples. Interpretation The core CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration (T-tau, P-tau, and A beta 42), CSF NFL, and plasma T-tau were strongly associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease and the core biomarkers were strongly associated with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\\'s disease. Emerging CSF biomarkers NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderately associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, whereas plasma A beta 42 and A beta 40 were not. Due to their consistency, T-tau, P-tau, A beta 42, and NFL in CSF should be used in clinical practice and clinical research. Neurofilament light protein in blood as a potential biomarker of neurodegeneration in Huntington\\'s disease: a retrospective cohort analysis Summary Background Blood biomarkers of neuronal damage could facilitate clinical management of and therapeutic development for Huntington\\'s disease. We investigated whether neurofilament light protein NfL (also known as NF-L) in blood is a potential prognostic marker of neurodegeneration in patients with Huntington\\'s disease. Methods We did a retrospective analysis of healthy controls and carriers of CAG expansion mutations in HTT participating in the 3-year international TRACK-HD study. We studied associations between NfL concentrations in plasma and clinical and MRI neuroimaging findings, namely cognitive function, motor function, and brain volume (global and regional). We used random effects models to analyse cross-sectional associations at each study visit and to assess changes from baseline, with and without adjustment for age and CAG repeat count. In an independent London-based cohort of 37 participants (23 HTT mutation carriers and 14 controls), we further assessed whether concentrations of NfL in plasma correlated with those in CSF. Findings Baseline and follow-up plasma samples were available from 97 controls and 201 individuals carrying HTT mutations. Mean concentrations of NfL in plasma at baseline were significantly higher in HTT mutation carriers than in controls (3·63 [SD 0·54] log pg/mL vs 2·68 [0·52] log pg/mL, p<0·0001) and the difference increased from one disease stage to the next. At any given timepoint, NfL concentrations in plasma correlated with clinical and MRI findings. In longitudinal analyses, baseline NfL concentration in plasma also correlated significantly with subsequent decline in cognition (symbol-digit modality test r=–0·374, p<0·0001; Stroop word reading r=–0·248, p=0·0033), total functional capacity (r=–0·289, p=0·0264), and brain atrophy (caudate r=0·178, p=0·0087; whole-brain r=0·602, p<0·0001; grey matter r=0·518, p<0·0001; white matter r=0·588, p<0·0001; and ventricular expansion r=–0·589, p<0·0001). All changes except Stroop word reading and total functional capacity remained significant after adjustment for age and CAG repeat count. In 104 individuals with premanifest Huntington\\'s disease, NfL concentration in plasma at baseline was associated with subsequent clinical onset during the 3-year follow-up period (hazard ratio 3·29 per log pg/mL, 95% CI 1·48–7·34, p=0·0036). Concentrations of NfL in CSF and plasma were correlated in mutation carriers (r=0·868, p<0·0001). Interpretation NfL in plasma shows promise as a potential prognostic blood biomarker of disease onset and progression in Huntington\\'s disease.

Stage at which riluzole treatment prolongs survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a retrospective analysis of data from a dose-ranging study Background Riluzole is the only drug to prolong survival for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, at a dose of 100 mg, was associated with a 35% reduction in mortality in a clinical trial. A key question is whether the survival benefit occurs at an early stage of disease, late stage, or is spread throughout the course of the disease. To address this question, we used the King\\'s clinical staging system to do a retrospective analysis of data from the original dose-ranging clinical trial of riluzole.\\xa0Methods In the original dose-ranging trial, patients were enrolled between December, 1992, and November, 1993, in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, the USA, and the UK if they had probable or definite ALS as defined by the El Escorial criteria. The censor date for the riluzole survival data was set as the original study end date of Dec 31, 1994. For this analysis, King\\'s clinical ALS stage was estimated from the electronic case record data of the modified Norris scale, UK Medical Research Council score for muscle strength, El Escorial category, vital capacity, and gastrostomy insertion data. The lowest allocated stage was 2 because the original trial only included patients with probable or definite ALS. We used a χ2 test to assess the independence of stage at trial enrolment and treatment group, Kaplan-Meier product limit distribution to test the transition from each stage to subsequent stages, and Cox regression to confirm an effect of treatment group on time in stage, controlling for covariates. We did sensitivity analyses by combining treatment groups, using alternative strategies to stage, stratifying by stage at trial enrolment, and using multistate outcome analysis of treatments (MOAT).\\xa0Findings We analysed the case records of all 959 participants from the original dose-ranging trial, 237 assigned to 50 mg/day riluzole, 236 to 100 mg/day, 244 to 200 mg/day, and 242 to daily placebo. Clinical stage at enrolment did not significantly differ between treatment groups (p=0·22). Time in stage 4 was longer for patients receiving 100 mg/day riluzole than for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·36–0·83; log-rank p=0·037). Combining treatment groups and stratifying by stage at enrolment showed a similar result (HR 0·638, 95% CI 0·464–0·878; p=0·006), as did analysis with MOAT where the mean number of days spent in stage 4 was numerically higher for patients given riluzole at higher doses compared with patients receiving placebo. Time from stages 2 or 3 to subsequent stages or death did not differ between riluzole treatment groups and placebo (p=0·83 for stage 2 and 0·88 for stage 3).\\xa0Interpretation We showed that riluzole prolongs survival in the last clinical stage of ALS; this finding needs to be confirmed in a prospective study, and treatment effects at stage 1 still need to be analysed. The ALS stage at which benefit occurs is important for counselling of patients before starting treatment. Staging should be used in future ALS clinical trials to assess the stage at which survival benefit occurs, and a similar approach could be used for other neurodegenerative diseases.\\xa0Funding NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, The European Union Joint Programme on Neurodegeneration, and the King\\'s Summer Undergraduate Studentship. Exploring Strategies To Bias Sequence in Natural and Synthetic Oligomers and Polymers Millions of years of biological evolution have driven the development of highly sophisticated molecular machinery found within living systems. These systems produce polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids with incredible fidelity and function. In nature, the precise molecular sequence is the factor that determines the function of these macromolecules. Given that the ability to precisely define sequence emerges naturally, the fact that biology achieves unprecedented control over the unit sequence of the monomers through evolved enzymatic catalysis is incredible. Indeed, the ability to engineer systems that allow polymer synthesis with precise sequence control is a feat that technology is yet to replicate in artificial synthetic systems. This is the case because, without access to evolutionary control for finely tuned biological catalysts, the inability to correct errors or harness multiple competing processes means that the prospects for digital control of polymerization have been firmly bootstrapped to biological systems or limited to stepwise synthetic protocols.\\\\ud \\\\ud In this Account, we give an overview of strategies that have been used over the last 5 years in efforts to program polymer synthesis with sequence control in the laboratory. We also briefly explore how the use of robotics, algorithms, and stochastic chemical processes might lead to new understanding, mechanisms, and strategies to achieve full digital control. The aim is to see whether it is possible to go beyond bootstrapping to biological polymers or stepwise chemical synthesis. We start by describing nonenzymatic techniques used to obtain sequence-controlled natural polymers, a field that lends itself to direct application of insights gleaned from biology. We discuss major advances, such as the use of rotaxane-based molecular machines and templated approaches, including the utilization of biological polymers as templates for purely synthetic chains. We then discuss synthetic polymer chemistry, whose array of techniques allows the production of polymers with enormous structural and functional diversity, but so far with only limited control over the unit sequence itself.\\\\ud \\\\ud Synthetic polymers can be subdivided into multiple classes depending on the nature of processes used to synthesize them, such as by addition or condensation. Consequently, varied approaches for sequence control have been demonstrated in the area, including but not limited to click reactions, iterative solid-phase chemistry, and exploiting the chemical affinity of the monomers themselves. In addition to those, we highlight the importance of environmental bias in possible control of polymerization at the single-unit level, such as using catalyst switching or external stimuli.\\\\ud \\\\ud Even the most successful experimental sequence control approach needs appropriate tools to verify its scope and validity; therefore, we devote part of the present Account to possible analytical approaches to sequence readout, starting with well-established tandem mass spectrometry techniques and touching on those more applicable to specific classes of processes, such as diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss progress in modeling and automation of sequence-controlled polymers.\\\\ud \\\\ud We postulate that developments in analytical chemistry, bioinformatics, and computer modeling will lead to new ways of exploring the development of new strategies for the realization of sequence control by means of sequence bias. This is the case because treating the assembly of polymers as a network of chemical reactions will enable the development of control strategies that can bias the outcome of the polymer assembly. The grand aim would be the synthesis of complex polymers in one step with a precisely defined digital sequence. Histology-Compatible MALDI Mass Spectrometry Based Imaging of Neuronal Lipids for Subsequent Immunofluorescent Staining Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) enables acquisition of spatial distribution maps for molecular species in situ. This can provide comprehensive insights on the pathophysiology of different diseases. However, current sample preparation and MALDI-IMS acquisition methods have limitations in preserving molecular and histological tissue morphology, resulting in interfered correspondence of MALDI-IMS data with subsequently acquired immunofluorescent staining results. We here investigated the histology compatibility of MALDI-IMS to image neuronal lipids in rodent brain tissue with subsequent immunohistochemistry and fluorescent staining of histological features. This was achieved by sublimation of a low ionization energy matrix compound, 1,5-diaminonapthalene (1,5-DAN), minimizing the number of low-energy laser shots. This yielded improved lipid spectral quality and speed of data acquisition and reduced matrix cluster formation along with preservation of specific histological information at cellular levels. This gentle, histology-compatible MALDI-IMS protocol also diminished thermal effects and mechanical stress created during nanosecond laser ablation processes that were prominent in subsequent immunofluorescent staining images but not with classical hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining on the same tissue section. Furthermore, this methodology proved to be a powerful strategy for investigating β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque-associated neuronal lipids as exemplified by performing high-resolution MALDI-IMS with subsequent fluorescent amyloid staining in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\\'s disease (tgSwe). A Novel Lipidomics Workflow for Improved Human Plasma Identification and Quantification Using RPLC-MSn Methods and Isotope Dilution Strategies Lipid identification and quantification are essential objectives in comprehensive lipidomics studies challenged by the high number of lipids, their chemical diversity, and their dynamic range. In this work, we developed a tailored method for profiling and quantification combining (1) isotope dilution, (2) enhanced isomer separation by C30 fused-core reversed-phase material, and (3) parallel Orbitrap and ion trap detection by the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid mass spectrometer. The combination of parallelizable ion analysis without time loss together with different fragmentation techniques (HCD/CID) and an inclusion list led to higher quality in lipid identifications exemplified in human plasma and yeast samples. Moreover, we used lipidome isotope-labeling of yeast (LILY)—a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris—to produce (nonradioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast. We integrated the 13C lipids in the LC-MS workflow to enable relative and absolute comp... Multimodal Chemical Imaging of Amyloid Plaque Polymorphism Reveals Aβ Aggregation Dependent Anionic Lipid Accumulations and Metabolism Amyloid plaque formation constitutes one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is suggested to be a critical factor driving disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, in patients that display amyloid pathology but remain cognitively normal, Aβ deposits are predominantly of diffuse morphology suggesting that cored plaque formation is primarily associated with cognitive deterioration and AD pathogenesis. Little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for conversion of monomeric Aβ into neurotoxic aggregates and the predominantly cored deposits observed in AD. The structural diversity among Aβ plaques, including cored/compact- and diffuse, may be linked to their distinct Aβ profile and other chemical species including neuronal lipids. We developed a novel, chemical imaging paradigm combining matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) and fluorescent amyloid staining. This multimodal imaging approach was used to probe the lipid chemistry... Caging and Photoactivation in Single-Molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Experiments Caged organic fluorophores are established tools for localization-based super-resolution imaging. Their use relies on reversible deactivation of standard organic fluorophores by chemical reduction or commercially available caged dyes with ON switching of the fluorescent signal by ultraviolet (UV) light. Here, we establish caging of cyanine fluorophores and caged rhodamine dyes, i.e., chemical deactivation of fluorescence, for single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments with freely diffusing molecules. They allow temporal separation and sorting of multiple intramolecular donor acceptor pairs during solution-based smFRET. We use this \"caged FRET\" methodology for the study of complex biochemical species such as multisubunit proteins or nucleic acids containing more than two fluorescent labels. Proof-of-principle experiments and a characterization of the uncaging process in the confocal volume are presented. These reveal that chemical caging and UV reactivation allow temporal uncoupling of convoluted fluorescence signals from, e.g., multiple spectrally similar donor or acceptor molecules on nucleic acids. We also use caging without UV reactivation to remove unwanted overlabeled species in experiments with the homotrimeric membrane transporter BetP. We finally outline further possible applications of the caged FRET methodology, such as the study of weak biochemical interactions, which are otherwise impossible with diffusion-based smFRET techniques because of the required low concentrations of fluorescently labeled biomolecules. Photomodulation of Two-Dimensional Self-Assembly of Azobenzene–Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene–Azobenzene Triads Achieving exquisite control over self-assembly of functional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nanographene (NG) is essential for their exploitation as active elements in (nano)technological applications. In the framework of our effort to leverage their functional complexity, we designed and synthesized two hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) triads, pAHA and oAHA, decorated with two light-responsive azobenzene moieties at the pseudo-para and ortho positions, respectively. Their photoisomerization in solution is demonstrated by UVâEuro\"vis absorption. 1H NMR measurements of oAHA suggested 23% of Z-form can be obtained at a photostationary state with UV irradiation (366 nm). Scanning tunneling microscopy imaging revealed that the self-assembly of pAHA and oAHA at the solidâEuro\"liquid interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and their solution in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene can be modulated upon light irradiation. This is in contrast to our previous work using HBC bearing a single azobenzene moiety, which did not show such photomodulation of the self-assembled structure. Upon E-Z isomerization both pAHA and oAHA displayed an increased packing density on the surface of graphite. Moreover, pAHA revealed a change of self-assembled pattern from an oblique unit cell to a dimer row rectangular crystal lattice whereas the assembly of oAHA retained a dimer row structure before and after light irradiation, yet with a modification of the inter-row molecular orientation. Molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics simulations validated the self-assembly patterns of pAHA and oAHA, comprising azobenzenes in their Z-forms. These results pave the way toward use of suitably functionalized large PAHs, as well as NGs, to develop photoswitchable devices. Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Cyclobutanes by Olefin [2\\u202f+\\u202f2] Photocycloaddition Reactions The [2\\u202f+\\u202f2] photocycloaddition is undisputedly the most important and most frequently used photochemical reaction. In this review, it is attempted to cover all recent aspects of [2\\u202f+\\u202f2] photocycloaddition chemistry with an emphasis on synthetically relevant, regio-, and stereoselective reactions. The review aims to comprehensively discuss relevant work, which was done in the field in the last 20 years (i.e., from 1995 to 2015). Organization of the data follows a subdivision according to mechanism and substrate classes. Cu(I) and PET (photoinduced electron transfer) catalysis are treated separately in sections 2 and 4, whereas the vast majority of photocycloaddition reactions which occur by direct excitation or sensitization are divided within section 3 into individual subsections according to the photochemically excited olefin. Principles and Applications of Nucleic Acid Strand Displacement Reactions Dynamic DNA nanotechnology, a subfield of DNA nanotechnology, is concerned with the study and application of nucleic acid strand-displacement reactions. Strand-displacement reactions generally proceed by three-way or four-way branch migration and initially were investigated for their relevance to genetic recombination. Through the use of toeholds, which are single-stranded segments of DNA to which an invader strand can bind to initiate branch migration, the rate with which strand displacement reactions proceed can be varied by more than 6 orders of magnitude. In addition, the use of toeholds enables the construction of enzyme-free DNA reaction networks exhibiting complex dynamical behavior. A demonstration of this was provided in the year 2000, in which strand displacement reactions were employed to drive a DNA-based nanomachine (Yurke, B.; et al. Nature 2000, 406, 605–608). Since then, toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions have been used with ever increasing sophistication and the field of dynam... Integrated Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles Coated with Polyoxometalate Clusters Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been found to be good end-capping ligands for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Herein, we introduce a new synthetic method to synthesize gold nanoparticle–POM hybrids by heating a solution of AuNO3(PMe3) in acetonitrile in the presence of appropriate POM species with tetrabutylammonium (TBA) as a countercation at 120 °C in a microwave. This method allowed us to produce POM-capped AuNPs without over-reduction of the solution causing decomposition or reorganization of the POMs. Analysis of the resulting material by transmission electron microscopy showed that the POM’s size, charge, and functionality are key factors controlling the resulting POM–AuNP hybrid structure. Additionally, the reaction was monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The ESI-MS studies reveal crucial information regarding the nature of the reaction that takes place, showing the cation exchange between Au(I) and TBA cations, followed by self-reduction of the Me3PAu(I)–POM complex. Evaluation and Characterization of Trk Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pain: Reliable Binding Affinity Predictions from Theory and Computation Optimization of ligand binding affinity to the target protein of interest is a primary objective in small-molecule drug discovery. Until now, the prediction of binding affinities by computational methods has not been widely applied in the drug discovery process, mainly because of its lack of accuracy and reproducibility as well as the long turnaround times required to obtain results. Herein we report on a collaborative study that compares tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) binding affinity predictions using two recently formulated fast computational approaches, namely, Enhanced Sampling of Molecular dynamics with Approximation of Continuum Solvent (ESMACS) and Thermodynamic Integration with Enhanced Sampling (TIES), to experimentally derived TrkA binding affinities for a set of Pfizer pan-Trk compounds. ESMACS gives precise and reproducible results and is applicable to highly diverse sets of compounds. It also provides detailed chemical insight into the nature of ligand–protein binding. TIES can predict and thus optimize more subtle changes in binding affinities between compounds of similar structure. Individual binding affinities were calculated in a few hours, exhibiting good correlations with the experimental data of 0.79 and 0.88 from the ESMACS and TIES approaches, respectively. The speed, level of accuracy, and precision of the calculations are such that the affinity predictions can be used to rapidly explain the effects of compound modifications on TrkA binding affinity. The methods could therefore be used as tools to guide lead optimization efforts across multiple prospective structurally enabled programs in the drug discovery setting for a wide range of compounds and targets. KDEEP: Protein–Ligand Absolute Binding Affinity Prediction via 3D-Convolutional Neural Networks Accurately predicting protein–ligand binding affinities is an important problem in computational chemistry since it can substantially accelerate drug discovery for virtual screening and lead optimization. We propose here a fast machine-learning approach for predicting binding affinities using state-of-the-art 3D-convolutional neural networks and compare this approach to other machine-learning and scoring methods using several diverse data sets. The results for the standard PDBbind (v.2016) core test-set are state-of-the-art with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a RMSE of 1.27 in pK units between experimental and predicted affinity, but accuracy is still very sensitive to the specific protein used. KDEEP is made available via PlayMolecule.org for users to test easily their own protein–ligand complexes, with each prediction taking a fraction of a second. We believe that the speed, performance, and ease of use of KDEEP makes it already an attractive scoring function for modern computational ch... Shape-Based Generative Modeling for de Novo Drug Design In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to generate novel molecules starting from a seed compound, its three-dimensional (3D) shape, and its pharmacophoric features. The pipeline draws inspiration from generative models used in image analysis and represents a first example of the de novo design of lead-like molecules guided by shape-based features. A variational autoencoder is used to perturb the 3D representation of a compound, followed by a system of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that generate a sequence of SMILES tokens. The generative design of novel scaffolds and functional groups can cover unexplored regions of chemical space that still possess lead-like properties. PathwayMap: Molecular Pathway Association with Self-Normalizing Neural Networks Drug discovery suffers from high attrition because compounds initially deemed as promising can later show ineffectiveness or toxicity resulting from a poor understanding of their activity profile. In this work, we describe a deep self-normalizing neural network model for the prediction of molecular pathway association and evaluate its performance, showing an AUC ranging from 0.69 to 0.91 on a set of compounds extracted from ChEMBL and from 0.81 to 0.83 on an external data set provided by Novartis. We finally discuss the applicability of the proposed model in the domain of lead discovery. A usable application is available via PlayMolecule.org . Mechanisms Underlying Allosteric Molecular Switches of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 The metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is implicated in several CNS disorders making it a popular drug discovery target. Years of research have revealed allosteric mGlu5 ligands showing an unexpected complete switch in functional activity despite only small changes in their chemical structure, resulting in positive allosteric modulators (PAM) or negative allosteric modulators (NAM) for the same scaffold. Up to now, the origins of this effect are not understood, causing difficulties in a drug discovery context. In this work, experimental data was gathered and analyzed alongside docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations for three sets of PAM and NAM pairs. The results consistently show the role of specific interactions formed between ligand substituents and amino acid side chains that block or promote local movements associated with receptor activation. The work provides an explanation for how such small structural changes lead to remarkable ... Intuition-Enabled Machine Learning Beats the Competition When Joint Human-Robot Teams Perform Inorganic Chemical Experiments <div> <p>Traditionally, chemists have relied on years of training and accumulated experience in order to discover new molecules. But the space of possible molecules so vast, only a limited exploration with the traditional methods can be ever possible. This means that many opportunities for the discovery of interesting phenomena have been missed, and in addition, the inherent variability of these phenomena can make them difficult to control and understand. The current state-of-the-art is moving towards the development of automated and eventually fully autonomous systems coupled with in-line analytics and decision-making algorithms. Yet even these, despite the substantial progress achieved recently, still cannot easily tackle large combinatorial spaces as they are limited by the lack of high-quality data. Herein, we explore the utility of active learning methods for exploring the chemical space by comparing collaboration between human experimenters with an algorithm-based search, against their performance individually to probe the self-assembly and crystallization of the polyoxometalate cluster Na<sub>6</sub>[Mo<sub>120</sub>Ce<sub>6</sub>O<sub>366</sub>H<sub>12</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>78</sub>]·200H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>). We show that the robot-human teams are able to increase the prediction accuracy to 75.6±1.8%, from 71.8±0.3% with the algorithm alone and 66.3±1.8% from only the human experimenters demonstrating that human-robot teams beat robots or humans working alone.</p> </div> A Scalable Molecular Force Field Parameterization Method Based on Density Functional Theory and Quantum-Level Machine Learning Fast and accurate molecular force field (FF) parameterization is still an unsolved problem. Accurate FFs are not generally available for all molecules, like novel druglike molecules. While methods based on quantum mechanics (QM) exist to parameterize them with better accuracy, they are computationally expensive and slow, which limits applicability to a small number of molecules. Here, we present an automated FF parameterization method which can utilize either DFT calculations or approximate QM energies produced by different neural network potentials (NNPs), to obtain improved parameters for molecules. We demonstrate that for the case of torchani-ANI-1x NNP, we can parameterize small molecules in a fraction of time compared with an equivalent parameterization using DFT QM calculations while producing more accurate parameters than FF (GAFF2). We expect our method to be of critical importance in computational structure-based drug discovery. The current version is available at PlayMolecule (www.playmolecule.org) and implemented in HTMD, allowing to parameterize molecules with different QM and NNP options. Rapid, Accurate, Precise, and Reliable Relative Free Energy Prediction Using Ensemble Based Thermodynamic Integration The accurate prediction of the binding affinities of ligands to proteins is a major goal in drug discovery and personalized medicine. The time taken to make such predictions is of similar importance to their accuracy, precision, and reliability. In the past few years, an ensemble based molecular dynamics approach has been proposed that provides a route to reliable predictions of free energies based on the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method which meets the requirements of speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability. Here, we describe an equivalent methodology based on thermodynamic integration to substantially improve the speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability of calculated relative binding free energies. We report the performance of the method when applied to a diverse set of protein targets and ligands. The results are in very good agreement with experimental data (90% of calculations agree to within 1 kcal/mol), while the method is reproducible by construction. Statistical uncertainties of the order of 0.5 kcal/mol or less are achieved. We present a systematic account of how the uncertainty in the predictions may be estimated. An Ensemble-Based Protocol for the Computational Prediction of Helix–Helix Interactions in G Protein-Coupled Receptors using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics The accurate identification of the specific points of interaction between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomers is essential for the design of receptor ligands targeting oligomeric receptor targets. A coarse-grained molecular dynamics computer simulation approach would provide a compelling means of identifying these specific protein–protein interactions and could be applied both for known oligomers of interest and as a high-throughput screen to identify novel oligomeric targets. However, to be effective, this in silico modeling must provide accurate, precise, and reproducible information. This has been achieved recently in numerous biological systems using an ensemble-based all-atom molecular dynamics approach. In this study, we describe an equivalent methodology for ensemble-based coarse-grained simulations. We report the performance of this method when applied to four different GPCRs known to oligomerize using error analysis to determine the ensemble size and individual replica simulation time required. Our measurements of distance between residues shown to be involved in oligomerization of the fifth transmembrane domain from the adenosine A2A receptor are in very good agreement with the existing biophysical data and provide information about the nature of the contact interface that cannot be determined experimentally. Calculations of distance between rhodopsin, CXCR4, and β1AR transmembrane domains reported to form contact points in homodimers correlate well with the corresponding measurements obtained from experimental structural data, providing an ability to predict contact interfaces computationally. Interestingly, error analysis enables identification of noninteracting regions. Our results confirm that GPCR interactions can be reliably predicted using this novel methodology. Ensemble-Based Replica Exchange Alchemical Free Energy Methods: The Effect of Protein Mutations on Inhibitor Binding The accurate prediction of the binding affinity changes of drugs caused by protein mutations is a major goal in clinical personalised medicine. We have developed an ensemble-based free energy approach called thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling (TIES), which yields accurate, precise and reproducible binding affinities. TIES has been shown to perform well for predictions of free energy differences of congeneric ligands to a wide range of target proteins. We have recently introduced variants of TIES, which incorporate the enhanced sampling technique REST2 (replica exchange with solute tempering) and the free energy estimator MBAR (Bennett acceptance ratio). Here we further extend the TIES methodology to study relative binding affinities caused by protein mutations when bound to a ligand, a variant which we call TIES-PM. We apply TIES-PM to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) to investigate binding free energy changes upon protein mutations. The results show that TIES-PM with REST2 successfully captures a large conformational change and generates correct free energy differences caused by a gatekeeper mutation located in the binding pocket. Simulations without REST2, however, fail to overcome the energy barrier between the conformations and hence the results are highly sensitive to the initial structures. We also discuss situations where REST2 does not improve the accuracy of predictions. Predicting Activity Cliffs with Free-Energy Perturbation Activity cliffs (ACs) are an important type of structure–activity relationship in medicinal chemistry where small structural changes result in unexpectedly large differences in biological activity. Being able to predict these changes would have a profound impact on lead optimization of drug candidates. Free-energy perturbation is an ideal tool for predicting relative binding energy differences for small structural modifications, but its performance for ACs is unknown. Here, we show that FEP can on average predict ACs to within 1.39 kcal/mol of experiment (∼1 log unit of activity). We performed FEP calculations with two different software methods: Schrodinger–Desmond FEP+ and GROMACS implementations. There was qualitative agreement in the results from the two methods, and quantitatively the error for one data set was identical, 1.43 kcal/mol, but FEP+ performed better in the second, with errors of 1.17 versus 1.90 kcal/mol. The results have far-reaching implications, suggesting well-implemented FEP calcula... A Quantitative Theoretical Framework For Protein-Induced Fluorescence Enhancement–Förster-Type Resonance Energy Transfer (PIFE-FRET) Single-molecule, protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) serves as a molecular ruler at molecular distances inaccessible to other spectroscopic rulers such as Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) or photoinduced electron transfer. In order to provide two simultaneous measurements of two distances on different molecular length scales for the analysis of macromolecular complexes, we and others recently combined measurements of PIFE and FRET (PIFE-FRET) on the single molecule level. PIFE relies on steric hindrance of the fluorophore Cy3, which is covalently attached to a biomolecule of interest, to rotate out of an excited-state trans isomer to the cis isomer through a 90° intermediate. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that accounts for relevant photophysical and kinetic parameters of PIFE-FRET, show how this framework allows the extraction of the fold-decrease in isomerization mobility from experimental data, and show how these results provide information on changes in the accessible volume of Cy3. The utility of this model is then demonstrated for experimental results on PIFE-FRET measurement of different protein-DNA interactions. The proposed model and extracted parameters could serve as a benchmark to allow quantitative comparison of PIFE effects in different biological systems. Transport Properties of Li-TFSI Water-in-Salt Electrolytes Water-in-salts are a new family of electrolytes that may allow the development of aqueous Li-ion batteries. They have a structure which is reminiscent of the one of ionic liquids, and they are characterized by a large concentration of ionic species. In this work we study their transport properties and how they evolve with concentration by using molecular dynamics simulations. We first focus on the choice of the force field. By comparing the simulated viscosities and self diffusion coefficients with experimental measurements, we select a set of parameters that reproduces well the transport properties. We then use the selected force field to study in detail the variations of the self and collective diffusivities of all the species as well as the transport number of the lithium ion. We show that correlation between ions and water play an important role over the whole concentration range. In the water-in-salt regime, the anions form a percolating network which reduces the cation-anion correlations and leads to rather large values for the transport number compared to other standard electrolytes. Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells: The Role of Alkyl Side Chain on Nanoscale Morphology of Sulfur Over-rich Regioregular Polythiophene/Fullerene Blends R e g i o r e g u l a r HH-TT p o l y ( 3 , 3 ′ - thioalkylbithiophene)s-bearing branched or linear alkyl sidechain substituents (PT2SR) have been synthesized and characterized to investigate their behavior, when used as electron-donor components in blend with a fullerene derivative [[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)] as an electron acceptor, in air-processed photovoltaic solar cells with bulk heterojunction architecture. The optoelectronic characteristics, energy gap, nanoscale morphology, and crystallinity of the blends (PT2SR/PCBM) were examined by ultraviolet− visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). We demonstrate that thioalkyl substituents are able to influence the PCBM self-assembly and the morphology of the polymeric film, important parameters to maximize the efficiency of the solar cell. In particular, the presence of chemical branching in the side chain of the sulfur over-rich polythiophene backbone favors the formation of PCBM clusters, of size of about 100 ± 30 nm, as confirmed by XRD and KPFM measurements. This facilitates the intermixing between donor and acceptor materials at the nanoscale level, determining an increase in the device performance. Photoemission Fingerprints for Structural Identification of Titanium Dioxide Surfaces The wealth of properties of titanium dioxide relies on its various polymorphs and on their mixtures coupled with a sensitivity to crystallographic orientations. It is therefore pivotal to set out methods that allow surface structural identification. We demonstrate herein the ability of photoemission spectroscopy to provide Ti LMV (V = valence) Auger templates to quantitatively analyze TiO_$_2_$ polymorphs. The Ti LMV decay reflects Ti 4sp-O 2p hybridizations that are intrinsic properties of TiO_$_2_$ phases and orientations. Ti LMV templates collected on rutile (110), anatase (101), and (100) single crystals allow for the quantitative analysis of mixed nanosized powders, which bridges the gap between surfaces of reference and complex materials. As a test bed, the anatase/rutile P25 is studied both as received and during the anatase-to-rutile transformation upon annealing. The agreement with X-ray diffraction measurements proves the reliability of the Auger analysis and highlights its ability to detect surface orientations. The Fate of Water at the Electrochemical Interfaces: Electrochemical Behavior of Free Water Versus Coordinating Water International audience; The water reduction that produces hydrogen is one key reaction for electrochemical energy storage. While it has been widely studied in traditional aqueous electrolytes for water splitting (electrolyzers), it also plays an important role for batteries. Indeed, the reduction of water at relatively high potential prevents the practical realization of high-voltage aqueous batteries, while water contamination is detrimental for organic battery electrolytes. Nevertheless, recent studies pointed toward the positive effect of traces of water for Li–air batteries as well as for the formation of solid-electrolyte interphase. Herein, we provide a detailed understanding of the role of the solvation on water reduction reaction in organic electrolytes. Using electrochemistry, classical molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we were able to demonstrate that (1) the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the species inside the electrochemical double layer directly controls the reduction of water and (2) water-coordinating strong Lewis acids such as Li+ cation are more reactive than free water (or noncoordinating) water molecules. Lipidomics Reveals Similar Changes in Serum Phospholipid Signatures of Overweight and Obese Pediatric Subjects Obesity is a public health problem and a risk factor for pathologies such type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given these clinical implications, there is a growing interest to understand the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity. Changes in lipid metabolism have been associated with obesity and obesity-related complications. However, changes in the lipid profile of obese children have been overlooked. In the present work, we analyzed the serum phospholipidome of overweight and obese children by HILIC-MS/MS and GC-MS. Using this approach, we have identified 165 lipid species belonging to the classes PC, PE, PS, PG, PI, LPC, and SM. The phospholipidome of overweight (OW) and obese (OB) children was significantly different from normal-weight children (control). Main differences were observed in the PI class that was less abundant in OW and OB children and some PS, PE, SM, and PC lipid species are upregulated in obese and overweight children. Although further studies are needed to clarify some association between phospholipid alterations and metabolic changes, our results highlight the alteration that occurs in the serum phospholipid profile in obesity in children. published Exchange Coupling Inversion in a High-Spin Organic Triradical Molecule The magnetic properties of a nanoscale system are inextricably linked to its local environment. In adatoms on surfaces and inorganic layered structures, the exchange interactions result from the relative lattice positions, layer thicknesses, and other environmental parameters. Here, we report on a sample-dependent sign inversion of the magnetic exchange coupling between the three unpaired spins of an organic triradical molecule embedded in a three-terminal device. This ferro-to-antiferromagnetic transition is due to structural distortions and results in a high-to-low spin ground-state change in a molecule traditionally considered to be a robust high-spin quartet. Moreover, the flexibility of the molecule yields an in situ electric tunability of the exchange coupling via the gate electrode. These findings open a route to the controlled reversal of the magnetic states in organic molecule-based nanodevices by mechanical means, electrical gating, or chemical tailoring. Twisting Fluorescence through Extrinsic Chiral Antennas Plasmonic antennas and planar structures have been undergoing intensive developments in order to control the scattering and absorption of light. One specific class, extrinsic chiral surfaces, that does not possess 2-fold rotational symmetry exhibits strong asymmetric transmission for different circular polarizations under obliquely incident illumination. In this work, we show that the design of those surfaces can be optimized with complex multipolar resonances in order to twist the fluorescence emission from nearby molecules. While this emission is usually dipolar and linearly polarized, the interaction with these resonances twists it into a multipolar radiation pattern with opposite helicity in different directions. The proposed structure maximizes this effect and provides control over the polarization of light. Splitting of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light is experimentally obtained in the backward direction. These results highlight the intricate interplay between the near-field absorption and the far-field scattering of a plasmonic nanostructure and are further used for modifying the emission of incoherent quantum sources. Our finding can potentially lead to the development of polarization- and angle-resolved ultracompact optical devices. Estimation of π–π Electronic Couplings from Current Measurements The {\\\\pi}-{\\\\pi} interactions between organic molecules are among the most important parameters for optimizing the transport and optical properties of organic transistors, light-emitting diodes, and (bio-) molecular devices. Despite substantial theoretical progress, direct experimental measurement of the {\\\\pi}-{\\\\pi} electronic coupling energy parameter t has remained an old challenge due to molecular structural variability and the large number of parameters that affect the charge transport. Here, we propose a study of {\\\\pi}-{\\\\pi} interactions from electrochemical and current measurements on a large array of ferrocene-thiolated gold nanocrystals. We confirm the theoretical prediction that t can be assessed from a statistical analysis of current histograms. The extracted value of t ca. 35 meV is in the expected range based on our density functional theory analysis. Furthermore, the t distribution is not necessarily Gaussian and could be used as an ultrasensitive technique to assess intermolecular distance fluctuation at the subangstr\\\\\"om level. The present work establishes a direct bridge between quantum chemistry, electrochemistry, organic electronics, and mesoscopic physics, all of which were used to discuss results and perspectives in a quantitative manner. Wavevector-Selective Nonlinear Plasmonic Metasurfaces Electromagnetic metasurfaces with strong non- linear responses and angular selectivity could o ff er many new avenues for designing ultrathin optics components. We investigated the optical second harmonic generation from plasmonic metasurfaces composed of aligned gold nanopillars with a pronounced out-of-plane tilt using a fl exible nonlinear Fourier microscope. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that these samples function as wavevector- selective nonlinear metasurfaces, that is, the coherent second harmonic signal does not only depend on the polarization and wavelength of the excitation beam, but also of its direction of incidence, in spite of the subwavelength thickness of the active layer. Speci fi cally, we observe that the nonlinear response can vary by almost two orders-of-magnitude when the incidence angle is changed from positive to negative values compared to the surface normal. Further, it is demonstrated that these metasurfaces act as a directional nonlinear mirrors, paving the way for new design of directional meta-mirrors in the nonlinear regime. Optical Input/Electrical Output Memory Elements based on a Liquid Crystalline Azobenzene Polymer Responsive polymer materials can change their properties when subjected to external stimuli. In this work, thin films of thermotropic poly(metha)acrylate/azobenzene polymers are explored as active layer in light-programmable, electrically readable memories. The memory effect is based on the reversible modifications of the film morphology induced by the photoisomerization of azobenzene mesogenic groups. When the film is in the liquid crystalline phase, the trans → cis isomerization induces a major surface reorganization on the mesoscopic scale that is characterized by a reduction in the effective thickness of the film. The film conductivity is measured in vertical two-terminal devices in which the polymer is sandwiched between a Au contact and a liquid compliant E-GaIn drop. We demonstrate that the trans → cis isomerization is accompanied by a reversible 100-fold change in the film conductance. In this way, the device can be set in a high- or low-resistance state by light irradiation at different wavelengths. This result paves the way toward the potential use of poly(metha)acrylate/azobenzene polymer films as active layer for optical input/electrical output memory elements. High-Performance Phototransistors Based on PDIF-CN2 Solution-Processed Single Fiber and Multifiber Assembly Here we describe the fabrication of organic phototransistors based on either single or multifibers integrated in three-terminal devices. These self-assembled fibers have been produced by solvent-induced precipitation of an air stable and solution-processable perylene di-imide derivative, i.e., PDIF-CN2. The optoelectronic properties of these devices were compared to devices incorporating more disordered spin-coated PDIF-CN2 thin-films. The single-fiber devices revealed significantly higher field-effect mobilities, compared to multifiber and thin-films, exceeding 2 cm2 V–1 s–1. Such an efficient charge transport is the result of strong intermolecular coupling between closely packed PDIF-CN2 molecules and of a low density of structural defects. The improved crystallinity allows efficient collection of photogenerated Frenkel excitons, which results in the highest reported responsivity (R) for single-fiber PDI-based phototransistors, and photosensitivity (P) exceeding 2 × 103 AW–1, and 5 × 103, respectively. ... Dynamically Switching the Electronic and Electrostatic Properties of Indium–Tin Oxide Electrodes with Photochromic Monolayers: Toward Photoswitchable Optoelectronic Devices The chemical modification of electrodes with organic materials is a common approach to tuning the electronic and electrostatic landscapes between interlayers in optoelectronic devices, thus facilitating charge injection at the electrode/semiconductor interfaces and improving their performance. The use of photochromic molecules for surface modification allows a\\xa0dynamic control of the electronic and electrostatic properties of the electrode and thereby enables additional functionalities in such devices. Here, we show that the electronic properties of a transparent indium–tin oxide (ITO) electrode are reversibly and dynamically modified by depositing organic photochromic switches (diarylethenes) in the form of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). By combining a range of surface characterization and density functional theory calculations, we present a detailed picture of the SAM binding to ITO, the packing density of molecules, their orientation, and work function modification of the ITO surface due to SAM depos... Enhanced Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derived Cardiomyocyte Maturation Using a Dual Microgradient Substrate Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) raise many possibilities for cardiac research but they exhibit an immature phenotype, which influences experimental outcomes. The aim of our research is to investigate the effects of a topographical gradient substrate on the morphology and function of commercially available hiPSC-CM. The lateral dimensions the microgrooves on the substrate varied from 8 to 100 μm space between the 8 μm grooves on one axis and from ∼5 nm to ∼1 μm in depth on the other axis. Cells were seeded homogeneously across the substrate and according to the manufacturers protocols. At days 4 and 10, measures of eccentricity, elongation, orientation, sarcomere length (SL), and contractility of the hiPSC-CM were taken. Only the deepest and widest region (8–30 μm wide and 0.85–1 μm deep) showed a significantly higher percentage of hiPSC-CM with an increased eccentricity (31.3 ± 6.4%), elongation (10.4 ± 4.3%), and orientation (<10°) (32.1 ± 2.7%) when compared with the control (flat substrate) (15.8 ± 5.0%, 3.4 ± 2.7%, and 10.6 ± 1.1%, respectively). Additionally, during stimulus-induced contraction, the relaxation phase of the twitch was prolonged (400 ms) compared to nonelongated cells (200 ms). These findings support the potential use of dual microgradient substrates to investigate substrate topographies that stimulate migration and/or maturation of hiPSC-CM. Designing Algorithms To Aid Discovery by Chemical Robots Recently, automated robotic systems have become very efficient, thanks to improved coupling between sensor systems and algorithms, of which the latter have been gaining significance thanks to the increase in computing power over the past few decades. However, intelligent automated chemistry platforms for discovery orientated tasks need to be able to cope with the unknown, which is a profoundly hard problem. In this Outlook, we describe how recent advances in the design and application of algorithms, coupled with the increased amount of chemical data available, and automation and control systems may allow more productive chemical research and the development of chemical robots able to target discovery. This is shown through examples of workflow and data processing with automation and control, and through the use of both well-used and cutting-edge algorithms illustrated using recent studies in chemistry. Finally, several algorithms are presented in relation to chemical robots and chemical intelligence for knowledge discovery. Novel Trimodal MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS3) at 10 μm Reveals Spatial Lipid and Peptide Correlates Implicated in Aβ Plaque Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Multimodal chemical imaging using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) can provide comprehensive molecular information in situ within the same tissue sections. This is of relevance for studying different brain pathologies such as Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD), where recent data suggest a critical relevance of colocalizing Aβ peptides and neuronal lipids. We here developed a novel trimodal, high-resolution (10 μm) MALDI imaging MS (IMS) paradigm for negative and positive ion mode lipid analysis and subsequent protein ion imaging on the same tissue section. Matrix sublimation of 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-DAN) enabled dual polarity lipid MALDI IMS on the same pixel points at high spatial resolutions (10 μm) and with high spectral quality. This was followed by 10 μm resolution protein imaging on the same measurement area, which allowed correlation of lipid signals with protein distribution patterns within distinct cerebellar regions in mouse brain. The demonstrated trimodal imaging strategy (IMS3) was further shown to be an efficient approach for simultaneously probing Aβ plaque-associated lipids and Aβ peptides within the hippocampus of 18 month-old transgenic AD mice (tgArcSwe). Here, IMS3 revealed a strong colocalization of distinct lipid species including ceramides, phosphatidylinositols, sulfatides (Cer 18:0, PI 38:4, ST 24:0) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC 16:0, LPC 18:0) with plaque-associated Aβ isoforms (Aβ 1-37, Aβ 1-38, Aβ 1-40). This highlights the potential of IMS3 as an alternative, superior approach to consecutively performed immuno-based Aβ staining strategies. Furthermore, the IMS3 workflow allowed for multimodal in situ MS/MS analysis of both lipids and Aβ peptides. Altogether, the here presented IMS3 approach shows great potential for comprehensive, high-resolution molecular analysis of histological features at cellular length scales with high chemical specificity. It therefore represents a powerful approach for probing the complex molecular pathology of, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by neurotoxic protein aggregation. Small Molecule Inhibitor of ATPase Activity of HSP70 as a Broad-Spectrum Inhibitor against Flavivirus Infections Flaviviruses including Zika virus, Dengue virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus and Yellow Fever virus cause heavy burdens to public health around the world. No specific antiviral drug was available in clinic against these flavivirus infections. Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) has recently been proven to be a promising antiviral target against Zika virus and Dengue virus. Here, we report that, Apoptozole, a small molecule inhibitor of ATPase activity of HSP70 has broad-spectrum anti-flavivirus potential. The mode of action analysis revealed that Apoptozole acted at post-entry step. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes related to cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and innate immunity were differentially expressed after treatment of Apoptozole. In vivo data suggested Apoptozole exerted protection effects against ZIKV infection in mouse model by enhancing innate immune response, which suggested a novel anti-ZIKV mechanism of HSP70 inhibitors. Key words: Flavivirus, Antiviral, Apoptozole, Zika virus, Innate immunity. Electrochemical Functionalization of Graphene at the Nanoscale with Self-Assembling Diazonium Salts We describe a fast and versatile method to functionalize high-quality graphene with organic molecules by exploiting the synergistic effect of supramolecular and covalent chemistry. With this goal, we designed and synthesized molecules comprising a long aliphatic chain and an aryl diazonium salt. Thanks to the long chain, these molecules physisorb from solution onto CVD graphene or bulk graphite, self-assembling in an ordered monolayer. The sample is successively transferred into an aqueous electrolyte, to block any reorganization or desorption of the monolayer. An electrochemical impulse is used to transform the diazonium group into a radical capable of grafting covalently to the substrate and transforming the physisorption into a covalent chemisorption. During covalent grafting in water, the molecules retain the ordered packing formed upon self-assembly. Our two-step approach is characterized by the independent control over the processes of immobilization of molecules on the substrate and their covalent ... “Supertrap” at Work: Extremely Efficient Nonradiative Recombination Channels in MAPbI3 Perovskites Revealed by Luminescence Super-Resolution Imaging and Spectroscopy Organo-metal halide perovskites are some of the most promising materials for the new generation of low-cost photovoltaic and light-emitting devices. Their solution processability is a beneficial trait, although it leads to a spatial inhomogeneity of perovskite films with a variation of the trap state density at the nanoscale. Comprehending their properties using traditional spectroscopy therefore becomes difficult, calling for a combination with microscopy in order to see beyond the ensemble-averaged response. We studied photoluminescence (PL) blinking of micrometer-sized individual methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite polycrystals, as well as monocrystalline microrods up to 10 μm long. We correlated their PL dynamics with structure employing scanning electron and optical super-resolution microscopy. Combining super-resolution localization imaging and super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI), we could detect and quantify preferential emitting regions in polycrystals exhibiting differe... Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Nanoparticles Containing Thiophene-S,S-dioxide: Tuning of Dimensions, Optical and Redox Properties, and Charge Separation under Illumination We describe the preparation of poly(3-hexylthiophene-S,S-dioxide) nanoparticles using Rozen\\'s reagent, HOF·CH3CN, either on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or on preformed P3HT nanoparticles (P3HT-NPs). In the latter case, core-shell nanoparticles (P3HT@PTDO-NPs) are formed, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, indicating the presence of oxygen on the outer shell. The different preparation modalities lead to a fine-tuning of the chemical-physical properties of the nanoparticles. We show that absorption and photoluminescence features, electrochemical properties, size, and stability of colloidal solutions can be finely modulated by controlling the amount of oxygen present. Atomic force microscopy measurements on the nanoparticles obtained by a nanoprecipitation method from preoxidized P3HT (PTDO-NPs) display spherical morphology and dimensions down to 5 nm. Finally, Kelvin probe measurements show that the coexistence of p- and n-type charge carriers in all types of oxygenated nanoparticles makes them capable of generating and separating charge under illumination. Furthermore, in core-shell nanoparticles, the nanosegregation of the two materials, in different regions of the nanoparticles, allows a more efficient charge separation. High, Anisotropic, and Substrate-Independent Mobility in Polymer Field-Effect Transistors Based on Preassembled Semiconducting Nanofibrils Achieving nanoscale control over the crystalline structure and morphology of electroactive polymer films and the possibility to transfer them onto any solid substrate are important tasks for the fabrication of highperformance organic/polymeric field-effect transistors (FETs). In this work, we demonstrate that ultrathin active layers preassembled at the water/air interface can possess high, anisotropic, and substrate-independent mobility in polymer FETs. By exploiting a modified approach to the Langmuir-Schaeffer technique, we self-assemble conjugated polymers in fibrillar structures possessing controlled thickness, nanoscale structure, and morphology; these highly ordered nanofibrils can be transferred unaltered onto any arbitrary substrate. We show that FETs based on these films possess high and anisotropic hole mobility approaching 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) along the nanofibrils, being over 1 order of magnitude beyond the state-of-the-art for Langmuir-Schaefer polymer FETs. Significantly, we demonstrate that the FET performances are independent of the chemical nature and dielectric permittivity of the substrate, overcoming a critical limit in the field of polymer FETs. Our method allows the fabrication of ultrathin films for low-cost, high-performance, transparent, and flexible devices supported on any dielectric substrate. Mode Coupling in Plasmonic Heterodimers Probed with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy While plasmonic antennas composed of building blocks made of the same material have been thoroughly studied, recent investigations have highlighted the unique opportunities enabled by making compositionally asymmetric plasmonic systems. So far, mainly heterostructures composed of nanospheres and nanodiscs have been investigated, revealing opportunities for the design of Fano resonant nanostructures, directional scattering, sensing and catalytic applications. In this article, an improved fabrication method is reported that enables precise tuning of the heterodimer geometry, with interparticle distances made down to a few nanometers between Au–Ag and Au–Al nanoparticles. A wide range of mode energy detuning and coupling conditions are observed by near field hyperspectral imaging performed with electron energy loss spectroscopy, supported by full wave analysis numerical simulations. These results provide direct insights into the mode hybridization of plasmonic heterodimers, pointing out the influence of each dimer constituent in the overall electromagnetic response. By relating the coupling of nondipolar modes and plasmon–interband interaction with the dimer geometry, this work facilitates the development of plasmonic heterostructures with tailored responses, beyond the possibilities offered by homodimers. Self-Similarity of Plasmon Edge Modes on Koch Fractal Antennas We investigate the plasmonic behavior of Koch snowflake fractal geometries and their possible application as broadband optical antennas. Lithographically defined planar silver Koch fractal antennas were fabricated and characterized with high spatial and spectral resolution using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The experimental data are supported by numerical calculations carried out with a surface integral equation method. Multiple surface plasmon edge modes supported by the fractal structures have been imaged and analyzed. Furthermore, by isolating and reproducing self-similar features in long silver strip antennas, the edge modes present in the Koch snowflake fractals are identified. We demonstrate that the fractal response can be obtained by the sum of basic self-similar segments called characteristic edge units. Interestingly, the plasmon edge modes follow a fractal-scaling rule that depends on these selfsimilar segments formed in the structure after a fractal iteration. As the size of a fractal structure is reduced, coupling of the modes in the characteristic edge units becomes relevant, and the symmetry of the fractal affects the formation of hybrid modes. This analysis can be utilized not only to understand the edge modes in other planar structures but also in the design and fabrication of fractal structures for nanophotonic applications. Photoluminescence Blinking of Single-Crystal Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Nanorods Induced by Surface Traps Photoluminescence (PL) of organometal halide perovskite materials reflects the charge dynamics inside of the material and thus contains important information for understanding the electro-optical properties of the material. Interpretation of PL blinking of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) nanostructures observed on polycrystalline samples remains puzzling owing to their intrinsic disordered nature. Here, we report a novel method for the synthesis of high-quality single-crystal MAPbI3 nanorods and demonstrate a single-crystal study on MAPbI3 PL blinking. At low excitation power densities, two-state blinking was found on individual nanorods with dimensions of several hundred nanometers. A super-resolution localization study on the blinking of individual nanorods showed that single crystals of several hundred nanometers emit and blink as a whole, without showing changes in the localization center over the crystal. Moreover, both the blinking ON and OFF times showed power-law distributions, indicating trapping-detrapping processes. This is further supported by the PL decay times of the individual nanorods, which were found to correlate with the ON/OFF states. Furthermore, a strong environmental dependence of the nanorod PL blinking was revealed by comparing the measurements in vacuum, nitrogen, and air, implying that traps locate close to crystal surfaces. We explain our observations by proposing surface charge traps that are likely related to under-coordinated lead ions and methylammonium vacancies to result in the PL blinking observed here. ispartof: ACS Omega vol:1 issue:1 pages:148-159 ispartof: location:United States status: published Mode Evolution in Strongly Coupled Plasmonic Dolmens Fabricated by Templated Assembly Plasmonic antennas have enabled a wealth of applications that exploit tailored near-fields and radiative properties, further endowed by the bespoke interactions of multiple resonant building blocks. Specifically, when the interparticle distances are reduced to a few nanometers, coupling may be greatly enhanced leading to ultimate near-field intensities and confinement along with a large energy splitting of resonant modes. While this concept is well-known, the fabrication and characterization of suitable multimers with controlled geometries and few-nanometer gaps remains highly challenging. In this article, we present the topographically templated assembly of single-crystal colloidal gold nanorods into trimers, with a dolmen geometry. This fabrication method enables the precise positioning of high-quality nanorods, with gaps as small as 1.5 nm, which permits a gradual and controlled symmetry breaking by tuning the arrangement of these strongly coupled nanostructures. To characterize the fabricated structures, we perform electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) near-field hyperspectral imaging and geometrically accurate EELS, plane wave, and eigenmode full-wave computations to reveal the principles governing the electromagnetic response of such nanostructures that have been extensively studied under plane wave excitation for their Fano resonant properties. These experiments track the evolution of the multipolar interactions with high accuracy as the antenna geometry varies. Our results provide new insights in strongly coupled single-crystal building blocks and open news opportunities for the design and fabrication of plasmonic systems. Color-Selective and Versatile Light Steering with up-Scalable Subwavelength Planar Optics Resonant waveguide gratings (RWGs) are subwavelength structures of great interest for biosensors, optical filters and optical security applications. We demonstrate and characterize a beam steering device, where the in-coupling and out-coupling processes make use of different RWGs that share the same ultrathin dielectric waveguide. This device enables selective color-filtering and redirection of a white light source (such as a white LED). Furthermore, this structure is compatible with up-scalable fabrication processes such as roll-to-roll replication, and is relevant for high-volume production. Because of its color selectivity and its use in low coherence illumination conditions, such a beam steering device could be implemented in a variety of optical applications such as optical security, multifocal or monochromatic lenses, biosensors, and see-through optical combiners for near-eye displays. Enhancement Mechanisms of the Second Harmonic Generation from Double Resonant Aluminum Nanostructures Multiresonant plasmonic nanoantennas have recently gained a lot of attention due to their ability to enhance nonlinear optical processes at the nanoscale. The first nanostructure designed for this purpose was an aluminum antenna composed of three arms, designed to be resonant at both the fundamental and the second harmonic frequencies. It was demonstrated that second harmonic generation induced by its resonances at both the fundamental and second harmonic wavelengths is higher than the one from a simple dipolar nanoantenna supporting a resonance at the fundamental wavelength only. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this strong nonlinear signal are still unclear. In this study, both advanced simulations and experiments are combined to investigate in details the role of the mode coupling in the enhancement of second harmonic generation. By varying the length of the nanoantenna arms, it is clearly demonstrated that second harmonic generation is enhanced when the coupling between the quadrupole and... Sizing and Discovery of Nanosized Polyoxometalate Clusters by Mass Spectrometry Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a powerful technique for structural characterization, e.g., sizing and conformation, particularly when combined with quantitative modeling and comparison to theoretical values. Traveling wave IM-MS (TW-IM-MS) has recently become commercially available to nonspecialist groups and has been exploited in the structural study of large biomolecules, however reliable calibrants for large anions have not been available. Polyoxometalate (POM) species—nanoscale inorganic anions—share many of the facets of large biomolecules, however, the full potential of IM-MS in their study has yet to be realized due to a lack of suitable calibration data or validated theoretical models. Herein we address these limitations by reporting DT-IM (drift tube) data for a set of POM clusters {M12} Keggin 1, {M18} Dawson 2, and two {M7} Anderson derivatives 3 and 4 which demonstrate their use as a TW-IM-MS calibrant set to facilitate characterization of very large (ca. 1–4 nm) anionic species. The data was also used to assess the validity of standard techniques to model the collision cross sections of large inorganic anions using the nanoscale family of compounds based upon the {Se2W29} unit including the trimer, {Se8W86O299} A, tetramer, {Se8W116O408} B, and hexamer {Se12W174O612} C, including their relative sizing in solution. Furthermore, using this data set, we demonstrated how IM-MS can be used to conveniently characterize and identify the synthesis of two new, i.e., previously unreported POM species, {P8W116}, unknown D, and {Te8W116}, unknown E, which are not amenable to analysis by other means with the approximate formulation of [H34W118X8M2O416]44–, where X = P and M = Co for D and X = Te and M = Mn for E. This work establishes a new type of inorganic calibrant for IM-MS allowing sizing, structural analysis, and discovery of molecular nanostructures directly from solution. Investigating the Transformations of Polyoxoanions Using Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Dynamics The reactions of [γ-SiW10O36]8– represent one of the most important synthetic gateways into a vast array of polyoxotungstate chemistry. Herein, we set about exploring the transformation of the lacunary polyoxoanion [β2-SiW11O39]8– into [γ-SiW10O36]8– using high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry, density functional theory, and molecular dynamics. We show that the reaction proceeds through an unexpected {SiW9} precursor capable of undertaking a direct β → γ isomerization via a rotational transformation. The remarkably low-energy transition state of this transformation could be identified through theoretical calculations. Moreover, we explore the significant role of the countercations for the first time in such studies. This combination of experimental and the theoretical studies can now be used to understand the complex chemical transformations of oxoanions, leading to the design of reactivity by structural control.

Solar-Driven Water Oxidation and Decoupled Hydrogen Production Mediated by an Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer Solar-to-hydrogen photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) have been proposed as a means of converting sunlight into H2 fuel. However, in traditional PECs, the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction are coupled, and so the rate of both of these is limited by the photocurrents that can be generated from the solar flux. This in turn leads to slow rates of gas evolution that favor crossover of H2 into the O2 stream and vice versa, even through ostensibly impermeable membranes such as Nafion. Herein, we show that the use of the electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB) H3PMo12O40 allows solar-driven O2 evolution from water to proceed at rates of over 1 mA cm–2 on WO3 photoanodes without the need for any additional electrochemical bias. No H2 is produced in the PEC, and instead H3PMo12O40 is reduced to H5PMo12O40. If the reduced ECPB is subjected to a separate electrochemical reoxidation, then H2 is produced with full overall Faradaic efficiency. Tuning the Rectification Ratio by Changing the Electronic Nature (Open-Shell and Closed-Shell) in Donor–Acceptor Self-Assembled Monolayers This Communication describes the mechanism of charge transport across self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of two donor–acceptor systems consisting of a polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) electron-acceptor moiety linked to an electron-donor ferrocene (Fc) unit supported by ultraflat template-stripped Au and contacted by a eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top contacts. The electronic and supramolecular structures of these SAMs were well characterized. The PTM unit can be switched between the nonradical and radical forms, which influences the rectification behavior of the junction. Junctions with nonradical units rectify currents via the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with a rectification ratio R = 99, but junctions with radical units have a new accessible state, a single-unoccupied molecular orbital (SUMO), which turns rectification off and drops R to 6. POMzites: A Family of Zeolitic Polyoxometalate Frameworks from a Minimal Building Block Library We describe why the cyclic heteropolyanion [P8W48O184]40– (abbreviated as {P8W48}) is an ideal building block for the construction of intrinsically porous framework materials by classifying and analyzing >30 coordination polymers incorporating this polyoxometalate (POM) ligand. This analysis shows that the exocyclic coordination of first-row transition metals (TMs) to {P8W48} typically yields frameworks which extend through {W–O–TM–O–W} bridges in one, two, or three dimensions. However, despite the rich structural diversity of such compounds, the coordination of TMs to the {P8W48} ring is poorly understood, and therefore largely unpredictable, and had not until now been present with any structural classification that could allow rational design. Herein, not only do we present a new approach to understand and classify this new class of materials, we also present three {P8W48}-based frameworks which complement those frameworks which have previously been described. These new compounds help us postulate a new taxonomy of these materials. This is possible because the TM coordination sites of the {P8W48} ring are found, once fully mapped, to lead to well-defined classes of connectivity. Together, analysis provides insight into the nature of the building block connectivity within each framework, to facilitate comparisons between related structures, and to fundamentally unite this family of compounds. Hence we have tentatively named these compounds as “POMzites” to reflect the POM-based composition and zeolitic nature of each family member, although crucially, POMzites differ from zeolites in the modular manner of their preparation. As the synthesis of further POMzites is anticipated, the classification system and terminology introduced here will allow new compounds to be categorized and understood in the context of the established materials. A better understanding of TM coordination to the {P8W48} ring may allow the targeted synthesis of new frameworks rather than the reliance on serendipity apparent in current methods. Strategies to Explore and Develop Reversible Redox Reactions of Li–S in Electrode Architectures Using Silver-Polyoxometalate Clusters Investigations of the Ag (I)-substituted Keggin K3[H3AgIPW11O39] as a bifunctional Lewis acidic and basic catalyst are reported that explore the stabilization of Li2Sn moieties so that reversible redox reactions in S-based electrodes would be possible. Spectroscopic investigations showed that the Li2Sn-moieties can be strongly adsorbed on the {AgIPW11O39} cluster, where the Ag(I) ion can act as a Lewis acid site to further enhance the adsorption of the S-moieties, and these interactions were investigated and rationalized using DFT. These results were used to construct an electrode for use in a Li-S battery with a very high S utilization of 94%, and a coulometric capacity of 1580 mAh g-1. This means, as a result of using the AgPOM, both a high active S content, as well as a high areal S mass loading, is achieved in the composite electrode giving a highly stable battery with cycling performance at high rates (1050 and 810 mAh g-1 at 1C and 2C over 100 to 300 cycles, respectively). Enantioselective Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition Reaction of Cyclic Enones and Its Application in a Synthesis of (−)-Grandisol The intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition of typical cyclic α,β-unsaturated enones, such as 2-cyclohexenone, with olefins was performed in moderate to good yields (42–82%) and with high enantioselectivity (82%–96% ee). An unusual substitution pattern at the chiral oxazaborolidine-AlBr3 Lewis acid complex that promotes the reaction was found to be crucial for the success of the reaction. The method was applied to the enantioselective synthesis of the monoterpene (−)-grandisol, which could be accomplished in six steps and with an overall yield of 13% starting from 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone. Sensitive Assays by Nucleophile-Induced Rearrangement of Photoactivated Diarylethenes Upon light-induced isomerization, diarylethenes (DAEs) equipped with reactive aldehyde moieties rearrange selectively in the presence of amines, accompanied by decoloration. In a comprehensive study, the probe structure was optimized with regard to its inherent reactivity in the nucleophile-triggered rearrangement reaction. Detailed structure−reactivity relationships could be derived, in particular with regard to the type of integrated (het)aryl moieties as well as the location of the formyl residue, and the probes’ intrinsic reactivity with primary and secondary amines was optimized. Utilizing an ancillary base, the initially formed rearrangement product can engage in a subsequent catalytic cycle, leading to an amplified decoloration process. This additional catalytic pathway allows us to enhance the sensitivity of our method and successfully discriminate between amines and thiols. Moreover, probes that exhibit strong analyte-induced fluorescence modulation have been designed to further decrease the detection limit by using a more sensitive read-out. The optimized DAE probes are promising molecular components for future programmable sensing materials and devices. Peer Reviewed Electronic Decoupling in C3-Symmetrical Light-Responsive Tris(Azobenzene) Scaffolds: Self-Assembly and Multiphotochromism International audience; We report the synthesis of a novel C3-symmetrical multiphotochromic molecule bearing three azobenzene units at positions 1, 3, 5 of the central phenyl ring. The unique geometrical design of such a rigid scaffold enables the electronic decoupling of the azobenzene moieties to guarantee their simultaneous isomerization. Photoswitching of all azobenzenes in solution was demonstrated by means of UV–vis absorption spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Scanning tunneling microscopy investigations at the solid–liquid interface, corroborated by molecular modeling, made it possible to unravel the dynamic self-assembly of such systems into ordered supramolecular architectures, by visualizing and identifying the patterns resulting from three different isomers, thereby demonstrating that the multiphotochromism is retained when the molecules are confined in two dimensions. Amorphous CaCO3: Influence of the Formation Time on Its Degree of Hydration and Stability Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is one of the most abundant biominerals that is prevalent in rocks and often used as a structural material in marine animals. Many of these natural CaCO3-based materials display excellent mechanical properties that are difficult to reproduce by man-made counterparts. This difficulty arises from the incomplete understanding of the influence of processing conditions on the structure and composition of CaCO3. To gain a better understanding of the evolution of the structure and composition of amorphous CaCO3 (ACC) particles during early stages, we introduce a new, organic solvent-free method that quenches this process with a high temporal resolution. We produce ACC particles inside small airborne drops that are formed with a microfluidic spray-dryer. These drops dry within 100 ms to 10 s and thereby arrest the formation of CaCO3 particles on that time scale. Using the microfluidic spray-dryer, we demonstrate that the amount of mobile water contained in ACC particles increases with increasing formation time and hence with increasing particle size. As a result of the higher concentration of mobile water, larger particles are less stable against temperature-induced solid-state crystallization and electron beam-induced decomposition than smaller counterparts. The amount of mobile water contained in ACC can be substantially reduced, and hence their kinetic stability against solid-state transformations increased, if certain organic additives, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), are incorporated. These insights might open up new opportunities to fabricate biomimetic CaCO3-based materials with tunable structures and hence with properties that can be adapted to the needs of specific applications. Stereoselective Assembly of Gigantic Chiral Molybdenum Blue Wheels Using Lanthanide Ions and Amino Acids The synthesis of chiral polyoxometalates (POMs) is a challenge because of the difficulty to induce the formation of intrinsically chiral metal-oxo frameworks. Herein we report the stereoselective synthesis of a series of gigantic chiral Mo Blue (MB) POM clusters 1–5 that are formed by exploiting the synergy between coordinating lanthanides ions as symmetry breakers to produce MBs with chiral frameworks decorated with amino acids ligands; these promote the selective formation of enantiopure MBs. All the compounds share the same framework archetype, based on {Mo124Ce4}, which forms an intrinsically chiral Δ or Λ configurations, controlled by the configurations of functionalized chiral amino acids. The chirality and stability of 1–5 in solution are confirmed by circular dichroism, 1H NMR, and electrospray ion mobility–mass spectrometry studies. In addition, the framework of the {Mo124Ce4} MB not only behaves as a host able to trap a chiral {Mo8} cluster that is not accessible by traditional synthesis but also promotes the transformation of tryptophan to kynurenine in situ. This work demonstrates the potential and applicability of our synthetic strategy to produce gigantic chiral POM clusters capable of host–guest chemistry and selective synthetic transformations. A New Class of Rigid Multi(azobenzene) Switches Featuring Electronic Decoupling: Unravelling the Isomerization in Individual Photochromes International audience; We report a novel class of star-shaped multiazobenzene photoswitches comprising individual photochromes connected to a central trisubstituted 1,3,5-benzene core. The unique design of such C3-symmetric molecules, consisting of conformationally rigid and pseudoplanar scaffolds, made it possible to explore the role of electronic decoupling in the isomerization of the individual azobenzene units. The design of our tris-, bis-, and mono(azobenzene) compounds limits the π-conjugation between the switches belonging to the same molecule, thus enabling the efficient and independent isomerization of each photochrome. An in-depth experimental insight by making use of different complementary techniques such as UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and advanced mass spectrometry methods as ion mobility revealed an almost complete absence of electronic delocalization. Such evidence was further supported by both experimental (electrochemistry, kinetical analysis) and theoretical (DFT calculations) analyses. The electronic decoupling provided by this molecular design guarantees a remarkably efficient photoswitching of all azobenzenes, as evidenced by their photoisomerization quantum yields, as well as by the Z-rich UV photostationary states. Ion mobility mass spectrometry was exploited for the first time to study multiphotochromic compounds revealing the occurrence of a large molecular shape change in such rigid star-shaped azobenzene derivatives. In view of their high structural rigidity and efficient isomerization, our multiazobenzene photoswitches can be used as key components for the fabrication of complex stimuli-responsive porous materials. Anisotropic Polyoxometalate Cages Assembled via Layers of Heteroanion Templates The synthesis of anisotropic redox-active polyoxometalates (POMs) that can switch between multiple states is critical for understanding the mechanism of assembly of structures with a high aspect ratio, as well as for their application in electronic devices. However, a synthetic methodology for the controlled growth of such clusters is lacking. Here we describe a strategy, using the heteroanion-directed assembly, to produce a family of 10 multi-layered, anisotropic POM cages templated by redox-active pyramidal heteroanions with the composition [W16Mo2O54(XO3)]n−, [W21Mo3O75/76(XO3)2]m−, and [W26Mo4O93(XO3)3]o− for the double, triple, and quadruple layered clusters, respectively. It was found that the introduction of reduced molybdate is essential for self-assembly and results in mixed-metal (W/Mo) and mixed-valence (WVI/MoV) POM cages, as confirmed by an array of analytical techniques. To probe the archetype in detail, a tetrabutyl ammonium (TBA) salt derivative of a fully oxidized two-layered cage is produced as a model structure to confirm that all the cages are a statistical mixture of isostructures with variable ratios of W/Mo. Finally, it was found that multilayered POM cages exhibit dipolar relaxations due to the presence of the mixed valence WVI/MoV metal centers, demonstrating their potential use for electronic materials. Investigating the Effects of Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures on the Wind Drought of 2015 Over the United States During the first quarter of 2015 the United States experienced a widespread and extended episode of low surface wind speeds. This episode had a strong impact on wind power generation. Some wind farms did not generate enough cash for their steady payments, and the value of some assets decreased. Although the wind industry expressed their concerns, the episode has not received much attention from the scientific community and remains weakly understood. In this paper we aim to fill this gap and advance understanding of the underlying processes at seasonal time scales. Using retrospective climate predictions, we find that high sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific ocean associated with a strongly positive phase of the North Pacific Mode played a central role to establish and maintain those wind anomalies. In a more general way it has also been shown that interannual variability of wind speed over North America is not only dominated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation but also by other sea surface temperature variations in the tropical Pacific. This new knowledge can be useful for industry stakeholders to anticipate future periods of low wind speed. Remote Sensing of Droplet Number Concentration in Warm Clouds: A Review of the Current State of Knowledge and Perspectives Abstract The cloud droplet number concentration (N d) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol‐cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide N d, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth (τ c) cloud droplet effective radius (r e) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78% is inferred for pixel‐level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1° ×1°\\xa0regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54% assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. N d uncertainty is dominated by errors in r e, and therefore, improvements in r e retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the N d retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing N d data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of N d data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative N d estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high‐quality ground‐based observations are examined. Trans-Dimensional Surface Reconstruction With Different Classes of Parameterization International audience; The use of Bayesian trans-dimensional sampling in 2-D and 3-D imaging problems has recently become widespread in geophysical inversion. Its benefits include its spatial adaptability to the level of information present in the data and the ability to produce uncertainty estimates. The most used parameterization in Bayesian trans-dimensional inversions is Voronoi cells. Here we introduce a general software, TransTessellate2D, that allows 2-D trans-dimensional inference with Voronoi cells and two alternative underlying parameterizations, Delaunay triangulation with linear interpolation and Clough-Tocher interpolation, which utilize the same algorithm but result in either C 0 or C 1 continuity. We demonstrate that these alternatives are better suited to the recovery of smooth models, and show that the posterior probability solution is less susceptible to multimodalities which can complicate the interpretation of model parameter uncertainties. On the Limits of CALIOP for Constraining Modeled Free Tropospheric Aerosol The spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument provides valuable information on the vertical distribution of global aerosol and is often used to evaluate vertical aerosol distributions in general circulation models (GCMs). Here we show, however, that the detection limit of the CALIOP retrievals mean background aerosol is not detected, leading to substantially skewed statistics that moreover differ significantly by product. In the CALIOP Level 2 product this missing low-backscatter aerosol results in the retrieved aerosol distribution significantly overrepresenting aerosol backscatter and extinction in the middle and upper troposphere if taken to be representative of the undetected aerosol. The CALIOP Level 3 product assumes no aerosol where none is detected, which then leads to an underestimation in the aerosol extinction profile in the upper troposphere. Using the ECHAM-HAM GCM, we estimate that the mean fraction of aerosol undetected by CALIOP daytime (nighttime) retrievals is 41% (44%) globally. Quantifying the Importance of Rapid Adjustments for Global Precipitation Changes Abstract Different climate drivers influence precipitation in different ways. Here we use radiative kernels to understand the influence of rapid adjustment processes on precipitation in climate models. Rapid adjustments are generally triggered by the initial heating or cooling of the atmosphere from an external climate driver. For precipitation changes, rapid adjustments due to changes in temperature, water vapor, and clouds are most important. In this study we have investigated five climate drivers (CO2, CH4, solar irradiance, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols). The fast precipitation responses to a doubling of CO2 and a 10‐fold increase in black carbon are found to be similar, despite very different instantaneous changes in the radiative cooling, individual rapid adjustments, and sensible heating. The model diversity in rapid adjustments is smaller for the experiment involving an increase in the solar irradiance compared to the other climate driver perturbations, and this is also seen in the precipitation changes. Understanding Rapid Adjustments to Diverse Forcing Agents Abstract Rapid adjustments are responses to forcing agents that cause a perturbation to the top of atmosphere energy budget but are uncoupled to changes in surface warming. Different mechanisms are responsible for these adjustments for a variety of climate drivers. These remain to be quantified in detail. It is shown that rapid adjustments reduce the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of black carbon by half of the instantaneous forcing, but for CO2 forcing, rapid adjustments increase ERF. Competing tropospheric adjustments for CO2 forcing are individually significant but sum to zero, such that the ERF equals the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing, but this is not true for other forcing agents. Additional experiments of increase in the solar constant and increase in CH4 are used to show that a key factor of the rapid adjustment for an individual climate driver is changes in temperature in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Contrasting Mechanical and Hydraulic Properties of Wet and Dry Fault Zones in a Proposed Shale‐Hosted Nuclear Waste Repository The attached documents correspond to the journal article, its supplementary material which is also available in the journal, and the data used in the figures. Satellite Observations of the Contrasting Response of Trees and Grasses to Variations in Water Availability Interannual variations in ecosystem primary productivity are dominated by water availability. Until recently, characterizing the photosynthetic response of different ecosystems to soil moisture anomalies was hampered by observational limitations. Here, we use a number of satellite-based proxies for productivity, including spectral indices, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and data-driven estimates of gross primary production, to reevaluate the relationship between terrestrial photosynthesis and water. In contrast to nonwoody vegetation, we find a resilience of forested ecosystems to reduced soil moisture. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and data-driven gross primary production indicate an increase in photosynthesis as a result of the accompanying higher amounts of light and temperature despite lowered light-use-efficiency. Conversely, remote sensing indicators of greenness reach their detection limit and largely remain stable. Our study thus highlights the differential responses of ecosystems along a tree cover gradient and illustrates the importance of differentiating photosynthesis indicators from those of greenness for the monitoring and understanding of ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The capacity of vegetation to thrive and to sequester carbon depends on how much water they can have access to. In this work, we evaluate how different types of satellite observations can describe the response of vegetation to changes in soil moisture over the entire planet. The first source of observation measures only the greenness of the land surface, the second measures light that is emitted by pigments in plants which are photosynthetically active (chlorophyll fluorescence), and the third are simulations of gross carbon uptake derived from machine learning techniques. For periods of water shortage all three indicate a reduction of growth in ecosystems with few trees. However, in cold boreal forests, when soil moisture is particularly low, we still detect an increase in photosynthesis due to higher light and temperature conditions, but this is not reflected in the greenness indicator. This work illustrates how lack of water is not necessarily harmful for catching carbon through photosynthesis, but to monitor this effect, we need remote sensing indicators that measure more than just how green the plants are, and fluorescence is likely a good candidate. A 3‐D Shear Wave Velocity Model for Myanmar Region International audience; Myanmar is located at the eastern margin of the ongoing Indo-Eurasian collision system, has experienced a complex tectonic history and is threatened by a high level of seismic hazard. Here we develop a crustal scale 3-D seismic velocity model of Myanmar, which is not only critical for understanding the regional tectonic setting and its evolution but can also provide the foundation for a variety of seismological studies, including earthquake location determinations, earthquake focal mechanism inversions, and ground motion simulations. We use the newly deployed Earth Observatory of Singapore-Myanmar broadband seismic network and other seismic stations in and around Myanmar to study the station-based 1-D velocity structure through a joint inversion of receiver functions, H/V amplitude ratio of Rayleigh waves, and surface wave dispersion measurements. Our results reveal a highly variable crustal structure across Myanmar region, characterized by a series of N-S trending sedimentary basins, with thicknesses up to~15 km in central Myanmar and an~5-km step in the depth of the Moho across the Sagaing-Shan Scarp fault system. We interpolate our station-based 1-D velocity profiles to obtain an integrated 3-D velocity model from southern Bangladesh to Myanmar. Using three regional earthquakes located to the south, within, and north of the seismic network, we show that our proposed model performs systematically better than the CRUST 1.0 model for both Pnl waves and surface waves. Our study provides a preliminary community velocity model for the region, with further refinements and interpretations anticipated in the near future. The Relative Influence of Atmospheric and Oceanic Model Resolution on the Circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean in a Coupled Climate Model It is often unclear how to optimally choose horizontal resolution for the oceanic and atmospheric components of coupled climate models, which has implications for their ability to make best use of available computational resources. Here we investigate the effect of using different combinations of horizontal resolutions in atmosphere and ocean on the simulated climate in a global coupled climate model (Alfred Wegener Institute Climate Model [AWI‐CM]). Particular attention is given to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Four experiments with different combinations of relatively high and low resolutions in the ocean and atmosphere are conducted. We show that increases in atmospheric and oceanic resolution have clear impacts on the simulated AMOC, which are largely independent. Increased atmospheric resolution leads to a weaker AMOC. It also improves the simulated Gulf Stream separation; however, this is only the case if the ocean is locally eddy resolving and reacts to the improved atmosphere. We argue that our results can be explained by reduced mean winds caused by higher cyclone activity. Increased resolution of the ocean affects the AMOC in several ways, thereby locally increasing or reducing the AMOC. The finer topography (and reduced dissipation) in the vicinity of the Caribbean basin tends to locally increase the AMOC. However, there is a reduction in the AMOC around 45°N, which relates to the reduced mixed layer depth in the Labrador Sea in simulations with refined ocean and changes in the North Atlantic current pathway. Furthermore, the eddy‐induced changes in the Southern Ocean increase the strength of the deep cell. A Statistical Model for Isolated Convective Precipitation Events To study the diurnal evolution of the convective cloud field, we develop a precipitation cell tracking algorithm which records the merging and fragmentation of convective cells during their life cycles, and apply it on large eddy simulation (LES) data. Conditioning on the area covered by each cell, our algorithm is capable of analyzing an arbitrary number of auxiliary fields, such as the anomalies of temperature and moisture, convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN). For tracks that do not merge or split (termed \"solitary\"), many of these quantities show generic, often nearly linear relations that hardly depend on the forcing conditions of the simulations, such as surface temperature. This finding allows us to propose a highly idealized model of rain events, where the surface precipitation area is circular and a cell\\'s precipitation intensity falls off linearly with the distance from the respective cell center. The drop-off gradient is nearly independent of track duration and cell size, which allows for a generic description of such solitary tracks, with the only remaining parameter the peak intensity. In contrast to the simple and robust behavior of solitary tracks, tracks that result from merging of two or more cells show a much more complicated behavior. The most intense, long lasting and largest tracks indeed stem from multi-mergers - tracks involved in repeated merging. Another interesting finding is that the precipitation intensity of tracks does not strongly depend on the absolute amount of local initial CAPE, which is only partially consumed by most rain events. Rather, our results speak to boundary layer cooling, induced by rain re-evaporation, as the cause for CAPE reduction, CIN increase and shutdown of precipitation cells. Process Understanding of Soil BVOC Fluxes in Natural Ecosystems: A Review Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) can be released from soils to the atmosphere through microbial decomposition of plant residues or soil organic carbon, root emission, evaporation of litter-stored BVOCs, and other physical processes. Soils can also act as a sink of BVOCs through biotic and abiotic uptake. Currently, the source and sink capabilities of soils have not been explicitly accounted for in global BVOC estimates from the terrestrial biosphere. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of soil BVOC processes and aim to propose a generic framework for modelling soil BVOCs based on current understanding and data availability. To achieve this target, we start by reviewing measured sources and sinks of soil BVOCs and summarize commonly reported compounds. Next, we strive to disentangle the drivers for the underlying biotic and abiotic processes. We have ranked the list of compounds, known to be emitted from soils, based on our current understanding of how each process controls emission and uptake. We then present a modelling framework to describe soil BVOC emissions. The proposed framework is an important step toward initializing modelling exercises related to soil BVOC fluxes. Finally, we also provide suggestions for measurements needed to separate individual processes, as well as explore long-term and large-scale patterns in soil BVOC fluxes. (Less) Framework for High‐End Estimates of Sea Level Rise for Stakeholder Applications International audience; An approach to analyze high-end sea level rise is presented to provide a conceptual framework for high-end estimates as a function of time scale, thereby linking robust sea level science with stakeholder needs. Instead of developing and agreeing on a set of high-end sea level rise numbers or using an expert consultation, our effort is focused on the essential task of providing a generic conceptual framework for such discussions and demonstrating its feasibility to address this problem. In contrast, information about high-end sea level rise projections was derived previously either from a likely range emerging from the highest view of emissions in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment (currently the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario) or from independent ad hoc studies and expert solicitations. Ideally, users need high-end sea level information representing the upper tail of a single joint sea level frequency distribution, which considers all plausible yet unknown emission scenarios as well as involved physical mechanisms and natural variability of sea level, but this is not possible. In the absence of such information we propose a framework that would infer the required information from explicit conditional statements (lines of evidence) in combination with upper (plausible) physical bounds. This approach acknowledges the growing uncertainty in respective estimates with increasing time scale. It also allows consideration of the various levels of risk aversion of the diverse stakeholders who make coastal policy and adaptation decisions, while maintaining scientific rigor. Circling in on Convective Organization Cold pools (CPs) contribute to convective organization. However, it is unclear by which mechanisms organization occurs. By using a particle method to track CP gust fronts in large eddy simulations, we characterize the basic collision modes between CPs. Our results show that CP interactions, where three expanding gust fronts force an updraft, are key at triggering new convection. Using this, we conceptualize CP dynamics into a parameter-free mathematical model: circles expand from initially random points in space. Where two expanding circles collide, a stationary front is formed. However, where three expanding circles enclose a single point, a new expanding circle is seeded. This simple model supports three fundamental features of CP dynamics: precipitation cells constitute a spatially interacting system; CPs come in generations; and scales steadily increase throughout the diurnal cycle. Finally, this model provides a framework for how CPs act to cause convective self-organization, clustering, and extremes. Increased Extreme Coastal Water Levels Due to the Combined Action of Storm Surges and Wind Waves The dependence between extreme storm surges and wind waves is assessed statistically along the global coasts using the outputs of two numerical models consistently forced with the same atmospheric fields. We show that 55% of the world coastlines face compound storm surge wave extremes. Hence, for a given level of probability, neglecting these dependencies leads to underestimating extreme coastal water levels. Dependencies are dominant in midlatitudes and are likely underestimated in the tropics due to limited representation of tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we show that in half of the areas with dependence, the estimated probability of occurrence of coastal extreme water levels increases significantly when it is accounted for. Translated in terms of return periods, this means that along 30% of global coastlines, extreme water levels expected at most once in a century without considering dependence between storm surges and waves become a 1 in 50-year event. The Sensitivity of Euro‐Atlantic Regimes to Model Horizontal Resolution There is growing evidence that the atmospheric dynamics of the Euro-Atlantic sector during winter is driven in part by the presence of quasi-persistent regimes. However, general circulation models typically struggle to simulate these, with e.g. an overly weakly persistent blocking regime. Previous studies have showed that increased horizontal resolution can improve the regime structure of a model, but have so far only considered a single model with only one ensemble member at each resolution, leaving open the possibility that this may be either coincidental or model-dependent. We show that the improvement in regime structure due to increased resolution is robust across multiple models with multiple ensemble members. However, while the high resolution models have notably more tightly clustered data, other aspects of the regimes may not necessarily improve, and are also subject to a large amount of sampling variability that typically requires at least three ensemble members to surmount. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity Estimated by Equilibrating Climate Models The methods to quantify equilibrium climate sensitivity are still debated. We collect millennial‐length simulations of coupled climate models and show that the global mean equilibrium warming is higher than those obtained using extrapolation methods from shorter simulations. Specifically, 27 simulations with 15 climate models forced with a range of CO2 concentrations show a median 17% larger equilibrium warming than estimated from the first 150 years of the simulations. The spatial patterns of radiative feedbacks change continuously, in most regions reducing their tendency to stabilizing the climate. In the equatorial Pacific, however, feedbacks become more stabilizing with time. The global feedback evolution is initially dominated by the tropics, with eventual substantial contributions from the mid‐latitudes. Time‐dependent feedbacks underscore the need of a measure of climate sensitivity that accounts for the degree of equilibration, so that models, observations, and paleo proxies can be adequately compared and aggregated to estimate future warming.\\\\ud \\\\ud \\\\ud Key points\\\\ud \\\\ud \\\\ud \\\\ud 27 simulations of 15 general circulation models are integrated to near equilibrium\\\\ud All models simulate a higher equilibrium warming than predicted by using extrapolation methods\\\\ud Tropics and mid‐latitudes dominate the change of the feedback parameter on different timescales on millennial timescales Analysis of the Atmospheric Water Budget for Elucidating the Spatial Scale of Precipitation Changes Under Climate Change Abstract Global mean precipitation changes due to climate change were previously shown to be relatively small and well constrained by the energy budget. However, local precipitation changes can be much more significant. In this paper we propose that for large enough scales, for which the water budget is closed (precipitation [P] roughly equals evaporation [E]), changes in P approach the small global mean value. However, for smaller scales, for which P and E are not necessarily equal and convergence of water vapor still plays a role, changes in P could be much larger due to dynamical contributions. Using 40 years of two reanalysis data sets, 39 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and additional numerical simulations, we identify the scale of transition in the importance of the different terms in the water budget to precipitation to be ~3,500–4,000 km and demonstrate its relation to the spatial scale of precipitation changes under climate change. Can Precursory Moment Release Scale With Earthquake Magnitude? A View From the Laboratory Today, earthquake precursors remain debated. While precursory slow slip is an important feature of earthquake nucleation, foreshock sequences are not always observed, and their temporal evolution remains poorly constrained. We report on laboratory earthquakes conducted under upper-crustal stress and fluid pressure conditions. The dynamics of precursors (slip, seismicity, and fault coupling) prior to the mainshock are dramatically affected by slight changes in fault conditions (fluid pressure and slip history). A relationship between precursory moment release and mainshock magnitude is systematically observed, independent of fault conditions. Based on nucleation theory, we derive a semiempirical scaling relationship which explains this trend for laboratory earthquakes. Several natural observations of earthquakes ranging from similar to M-w 6.0-9.0, where precursory moment release could be estimated, seem to follow the extrapolation of the laboratory-derived scaling law. Notwithstanding spatiotemporal complexity in natural seismicity, some moderate to large earthquake magnitudes might be estimated through integrated seismological and geodetic measurements of both seismic and aseismic slips during nucleation. Plain Language Summary Understanding the preparation phase that precedes earthquake ruptures (nucleation) is crucial for seismic hazard assessment because it might provide information on the impending earthquake. Here, we show that the temporal evolution of laboratory earthquake precursors (precursory slow slip, precursory seismicity, and fault coupling) is of little use in assessing an impending earthquake\\'s size. Nevertheless, independent of fault slip behavior (seismic or aseismic) and environmental conditions (stress state and fluid pressure and slip history), the amount of moment released during the preparation phase scales with the earthquake\\'s magnitude. This property is demonstrated by laboratory observations and earthquake nucleation theory and seems compatible with several natural observations of earthquakes ranging from M-w 6.0 to M-w 9.0. As a consequence, if earthquakes exhibit a preparation phase, it could be possible that this phase is larger or longer for higher magnitude earthquakes and consequently, more likely to be detectable. Decadal Predictions of the Probability of Occurrence for Warm Summer Temperature Extremes An analysis of a three-member ensemble of initialized coupled simulations with the MPI-ESM-LR covering the period 1901–2010 shows that Atlantic northward ocean heat transport (OHT) at 50°N influences surface temperature variability in the North Atlantic region for several years. Three to ten years after strong OHT phases at 50°N, a characteristic pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies emerges: warm anomalies are found in the North Atlantic and cold anomalies emerge in the Gulf Stream region. This pattern originates from persistent upper-ocean heat content anomalies that originate from southward-propagating OHT anomalies in the North Atlantic. Interannual-to-decadal SST predictability of yearly initialized hindcasts is linked to this SST pattern: when ocean heat transport at 50°N is strong at the initialization of a hindcast, SST anomaly correlation coefficients in the northeast Atlantic at lead years 2–9 are significantly higher than when the ocean heat transport at 50°N is weak at initialization. Surface heat fluxes that mask the predictable low-frequency oceanic variability that influences SSTs in the northwest Atlantic after strong OHT phases, and in the northwest and northeast Atlantic after weak OHT phases at 50°N lead to zonally asymmetrically predictable SSTs 7–9 years ahead. This study shows that the interannual-to-decadal predictability of North Atlantic SSTs depends strongly on the strength of subpolar ocean heat transport at the start of a prediction, indicating that physical mechanisms need to be taken into account for actual temperature predictions. New Generation of Climate Models Track Recent Unprecedented Changes in Earth\\'s Radiation Budget Observed by CERES International audience; We compare top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes observed by the Clouds and the Earth\\'s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and simulated by seven general circulation models forced with observed sea‐surface temperature (SST) and sea‐ice boundary conditions. In response to increased SSTs along the equator and over the eastern Pacific (EP) following the so‐called global warming “hiatus” of the early 21st century, simulated TOA flux changes are remarkably similar to CERES. Both show outgoing shortwave and longwave TOA flux changes that largely cancel over the west and central tropical Pacific, and large reductions in shortwave flux for EP low‐cloud regions. A model\\'s ability to represent changes in the relationship between global mean net TOA flux and surface temperature depends upon how well it represents shortwave flux changes in low‐cloud regions, with most showing too little sensitivity to EP SST changes, suggesting a “pattern effect” that may be too weak compared to observations. Fault Reactivation During Fluid Pressure Oscillations: Transition From Stable to Unstable Slip High‐pressure fluid injection in deep geo‐reservoirs can induce earthquakes. Recent observations suggest that cyclic injections might trigger less seismicity than monotonic injections. Here, we report triaxial laboratory experiments conducted on faulted quartz‐rich sandstone that provide new insight into the physics of fault‐fluid interactions subjected to cyclic fluid pressure variations. The experiments were performed at 30 and 45 MPa confining pressure, imposing constant or sinusoidal fluid pressure oscillations of amplitudes ranging from 0 to 8 MPa in addition to a far‐field constant loading rate (10‐4 and 10‐3 mm.s‐1). The results show that: (i) In agreement with the Mohr‐Coulomb theory, faults reactivate at the static friction criterion, which is generally reached at the maximum fluid pressure during oscillations. (ii) Oscillating fluid pressure perturbations promote seismic behaviour rather than aseismic slip, and (iii) increasing the oscillation\\'s amplitude enhances the onset of seismic activity along the fault. We demonstrate that this behaviour is caused by slip rate variations resulting from the fluid pressure oscillations. Without fluid pressure oscillations, increasing the far‐field loading rate also promotes seismic activity. Our experiments demonstrate that the seismicity intensification due to cyclic fluid injections could be promoted at shallow depth, where confining pressure is relatively low, resulting in large strain rate perturbations. Efficacy of Climate Forcings in PDRMIP Models Abstract Quantifying the efficacy of different climate forcings is important for understanding the real‐world climate sensitivity. This study presents a systematic multimodel analysis of different climate driver efficacies using simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). Efficacies calculated from instantaneous radiative forcing deviate considerably from unity across forcing agents and models. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is a better predictor of global mean near‐surface air temperature (GSAT) change. Efficacies are closest to one when ERF is computed using fixed sea surface temperature experiments and adjusted for land surface temperature changes using radiative kernels. Multimodel mean efficacies based on ERF are close to one for global perturbations of methane, sulfate, black carbon, and insolation, but there is notable intermodel spread. We do not find robust evidence that the geographic location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy. GSAT is found to respond more slowly to aerosol forcing than CO2 in the early stages of simulations. Despite these differences, we find that there is no evidence for an efficacy effect on historical GSAT trend estimates based on simulations with an impulse response model, nor on the resulting estimates of climate sensitivity derived from the historical period. However, the considerable intermodel spread in the computed efficacies means that we cannot rule out an efficacy‐induced bias of ±0.4 K in equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling when estimated using the historical GSAT trend. Improving Estimates of Gross Primary Productivity by Assimilating Solar‐Induced Fluorescence Satellite Retrievals in a Terrestrial Biosphere Model Using a Process‐Based SIF Model Abstract Over the last few years, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations from space have emerged as a promising resource for evaluating the spatio-temporal distribution of gross primary productivity (GPP) simulated by global terrestrial biosphere models. SIF can be used to improve GPP simulations by optimizing critical model parameters through statistical Bayesian data assimilation techniques. A prerequisite is the availability of a functional link between GPP and SIF in terrestrial biosphere models. Here we present the development of a mechanistic SIF observation operator in the ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems) terrestrial biosphere model. It simulates the regulation of photosystem II fluorescence quantum yield at the leaf level thanks to a novel parameterization of non-photochemical quenching as a function of temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and normalized quantum yield of photochemistry. It emulates the radiative transfer of chlorophyll fluorescence to the top of the canopy using a parametric simplification of the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) model. We assimilate two years of monthly OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF product at 0.5° (2015?2016) to optimize ORCHIDEE photosynthesis and phenological parameters over an ensemble of grid points for all plant functional types. The impact on the simulated GPP is considerable with a large decrease of the global scale budget by 28\\xa0GtC/year over the period 1990?2009. The optimized GPP budget (134/136\\xa0GtC/year over 1990?2009/2001?2009) remarkably agrees with independent GPP estimates, FLUXSAT (137\\xa0GtC/year over 2001?2009) in particular and FLUXCOM (121\\xa0GtC/year over 1990?2009). Our results also suggest a biome dependency of the SIF-GPP relationship that needs to be improved for some plant functional types. Peer reviewed Ensembles of Global Climate Model Variants Designed for the Quantification and Constraint of Uncertainty in Aerosols and Their Radiative Forcing Abstract Tropospheric aerosol radiative forcing has persisted for many years as one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model‐U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present‐day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is −1.45\\xa0W/m2 (credible interval of −2.07 to −0.81\\xa0W/m2), which encompasses but is more negative than the −1.17\\xa0W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and −0.90\\xa0W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The ensembles can be used to reduce aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty by challenging them with multiple measurements as well as to isolate potential causes of multimodel differences. Evaluation of FESOM2.0 Coupled to ECHAM6.3: Preindustrial and HighResMIP Simulations Abstract A new global climate model setup using FESOM2.0 for the sea ice‐ocean component and ECHAM6.3 for the atmosphere and land surface has been developed. Replacing FESOM1.4 by FESOM2.0 promises a higher efficiency of the new climate setup compared to its predecessor. The new setup allows for long‐term climate integrations using a locally eddy‐resolving ocean. Here it is evaluated in terms of (1) the mean state and long‐term drift under preindustrial climate conditions, (2) the fidelity in simulating the historical warming, and (3) differences between coarse and eddy‐resolving ocean configurations. The results show that the realism of the new climate setup is overall within the range of existing models. In terms of oceanic temperatures, the historical warming signal is of smaller amplitude than the model drift in case of a relatively short spin‐up. However, it is argued that the strategy of “de‐drifting” climate runs after the short spin‐up, proposed by the HighResMIP protocol, allows one to isolate the warming signal. Moreover, the eddy‐permitting/resolving ocean setup shows notable improvements regarding the simulation of oceanic surface temperatures, in particular in the Southern Ocean. A New Look at the Daily Cycle of Trade Wind Cumuli Abstract A description of the daily cycle of oceanic shallow cumulus for undisturbed boreal winter conditions in the North Atlantic trades is presented. Modern investigation tools are used, including storm‐resolving and large‐eddy simulations, runover large domains in realistic configurations, and observations from in situ measurements and satellite‐based retrievals. Models and observations clearly show pronounced diurnal variations in cloudiness, both near cloud base and below the trade inversion. The daily cycle reflects the evolution of two cloud populations: (i) a population of nonprecipitating small cumuli with weak vertical extent, which grows during the day and maximizes around sunset, and (ii) a population o deeper precipitating clouds with a stratiform cloud layer below the trade inversion, which grows during the night and maximizes just before sunrise. Previous studies have reported that cloudiness near cloud base undergoes weak variations on time scales longer than a day. However, here we find that it can vary strongly at the diurnal time scale. This daily cycle could serve as a critical test of the models\\' representation of the physical processes controlling cloudiness near cloud base, which is thought to be key for the determination of the Earth\\'s climate response to warming. Evaluation of CNRM Earth System Model, CNRM‐ESM2‐1: Role of Earth System Processes in Present‐Day and Future Climate International audience; This study introduces CNRM‐ESM2‐1, the Earth system (ES) model of second generation developed by CNRM‐CERFACS for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). CNRM‐ESM2‐1 offers a higher model complexity than the Atmosphere‐Ocean General Circulation Model CNRM‐CM6‐1 by adding interactive ES components such as carbon cycle, aerosols, and atmospheric chemistry. As both models share the same code, physical parameterizations, and grid resolution, they offer a fully traceable framework to investigate how far the represented ES processes impact the model performance over present‐day, response to external forcing and future climate projections. Using a large variety of CMIP6 experiments, we show that represented ES processes impact more prominently the model response to external forcing than the model performance over present‐day. Both models display comparable performance at replicating modern observations although the mean climate of CNRM‐ESM2‐1 is slightly warmer than that of CNRM‐CM6‐1. This difference arises from land cover‐aerosol interactions where the use of different soil vegetation distributions between both models impacts the rate of dust emissions. This interaction results in a smaller aerosol burden in CNRM‐ESM2‐1 than in CNRM‐CM6‐1, leading to a different surface radiative budget and climate. Greater differences are found when comparing the model response to external forcing and future climate projections. Represented ES processes damp future warming by up to 10% in CNRM‐ESM2‐1 with respect to CNRM‐CM6‐1. The representation of land vegetation and the CO2‐water‐stomatal feedback between both models explain about 60% of this difference. The remainder is driven by other ES feedbacks such as the natural aerosol feedback. Present‐Day and Historical Aerosol and Ozone Characteristics in CNRM CMIP6 Simulations Abstract Characteristics and radiative forcing of the aerosol and ozone fields of two configurations of the Centre National de Recherches Météoroglogiques (CNRM) and Cerfacs climate model are analyzed over the historical period (1850–2014), using several Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) simulations. CNRM‐CM6‐1 is the atmosphere‐ocean general circulation model including prescribed aerosols and a linear stratospheric ozone scheme, while the Earth System Model CNRM‐ESM2‐1 has interactive tropospheric aerosols and chemistry of the midtroposphere aloft. The representations of aerosols and ozone in CNRM‐CM6‐1 are issued from simulations of CNRM‐ESM2‐1, and this ensures some comparability of both representations. In particular, present‐day anthropogenic aerosol optical depths are similar (0.018), and their spatial patterns correspond to those of reference data sets such as MACv2 and MACv2‐SP despite a negative bias. Effective radiative forcings (ERFs) have been estimated using 30‐year fixed sea surface temperature simulations (piClim) and several calls to the radiative scheme. Present‐day anthropogenic aerosol ERF, aerosol‐radiation ERF, and aerosol cloud ERF are fully within CMIP5 estimates and, respectively, equal to −1.10, −0.36, and −0.81\\xa0W\\xa0m −2 for CNRM‐CM6‐1 and −0.21, −0.61, and −0.74\\xa0W\\xa0m −2 for CNRM‐ESM2‐1. Additional CMIP6‐type piClim simulations show that these differences are mainly due to the interactivity of the aerosol scheme whose impact is confirmed when assessing the response of both climate model configurations to rising CO 2. Present‐day stratospheric ozone ERF, equal to −0.04\\xa0W\\xa0m −2, is in agreement with that of the CMIP6 ozone. No trend appears in the ozone ERF over the historical period although the evolution of the total column ozone is correctly simulated. Presentation and Evaluation of the IPSL‐CM6A‐LR Climate Model Abstract This study presents the global climate model IPSL‐CM6A‐LR developed at Institut Pierre‐Simon Laplace (IPSL) to study natural climate variability and climate response to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). This article describes the different model components, their coupling, and the simulated climate in comparison to previous model versions. We focus here on the representation of the physical climate along with the main characteristics of the global carbon cycle. The model\\'s climatology, as assessed from a range of metrics (related in particular to radiation, temperature, precipitation, and wind), is strongly improved in comparison to previous model versions. Although they are reduced, a number of known biases and shortcomings (e.g., double Intertropical Convergence Zone [ITCZ], frequency of midlatitude wintertime blockings, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation [ENSO] dynamics) persist. The equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response have both increased from the previous climate model IPSL‐CM5A‐LR used in CMIP5. A large ensemble of more than 30 members for the historical period (1850–2018) and a smaller ensemble for a range of emissions scenarios (until 2100 and 2300) are also presented and discussed. Bounding Global Aerosol Radiative Forcing of Climate Change Abstract Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40\\xa0years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth\\'s radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol‐radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol‐driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed‐phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of ‐1.6 to ‐0.6\\xa0W\\xa0m−2, or ‐2.0 to ‐0.4\\xa0W\\xa0m−2 with a 90% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial‐era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds. Constraining Uncertainty in Aerosol Direct Forcing The uncertainty in present-day anthropogenic forcing is dominated by uncertainty in the strength of the contribution from aerosol. Much of the uncertainty in the direct aerosol forcing can be attributed to uncertainty in the anthropogenic fraction of aerosol in the present-day atmosphere, due to a lack of historical observations. Here, we present a robust relationship between total present-day aerosol optical depth and the anthropogenic contribution across three multimodel ensembles and a large single-model perturbed parameter ensemble. Using observations of aerosol optical depth, we determine a reduced likely range of the anthropogenic component and hence a reduced uncertainty in the direct forcing of aerosol. Soil Uptake of Volatile Organic Compounds: Ubiquitous and Underestimated? Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from ecosystems to the atmosphere have been widely studied, and the importance of soil contributions to VOC fluxes has received increasing attention. We suggest that while soil VOC emissions may be important in some situations, soil uptake of VOCs by microbial degradation is likely an omnipresent process, as also recently suggested by Trowbridge et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005479). To be able to model net VOC fluxes, we need to be able to estimate both soil release and uptake processes and their drivers. Age as a Confounding Factor for the Accurate Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Advanced NAFLD Fibrosis OBJECTIVES Non-invasive fibrosis scores are widely used to identify/exclude advanced fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, these scores were principally developed and validated in patients aged between 35 and 65 years of age. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of age on the performance of non-invasive fibrosis tests in NAFLD. METHODS Patients were recruited from European specialist hepatology clinics. The cohort was divided into five age-based groups: ≤35 (n=74), 36-45 (n=96), 46-55 (n=197), 56-64 (n=191), and ≥65 years (n=76), and the performance of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio, fibrosis 4 (FIB-4), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) for advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) for each group was assessed using liver biopsy as the standard. RESULTS Six hundred and thirty-four patients were included. The diagnostic accuracy of the AST/ALT ratio was lower than NFS and FIB-4 in all the age groups. The AST/ALT ratio, NFS, and FIB-4 score performed poorly for a diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in those aged ≤35 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs 0.52, 0.52, and 0.60, respectively). For all groups >35 years, AUROCs for advanced fibrosis were similar for the NFS and FIB-4 score (range 0.77-0.84). However, the specificity for advanced fibrosis using the FIB-4 and NFS declined with age, becoming unacceptably low in those aged ≥65 years (35% for FIB-4 and 20% for NFS). New cutoffs were derived (and validated) for those aged ≥65 years, which improved specificity to 70% without adversely affecting sensitivity (FIB-4 2.0, sensitivity 77%; NFS 0.12, sensitivity 80%). CONCLUSIONS The NFS and FIB-4 scores have similar accuracy for advanced fibrosis in patients aged >35 years. However, the specificity for advanced fibrosis is unacceptably low in patients aged ≥65 years, resulting in a high false positive rate. New thresholds for use in patients aged ≥65 years are proposed to address this issue.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 11 October 2016; doi:10.1038/ajg.2016.453. Whither systems medicine? New technologies to generate, store and retrieve medical and research data are inducing a rapid change in clinical and translational research and health care. Systems medicine is the interdisciplinary approach wherein physicians and clinical investigators team up with experts from biology, biostatistics, informatics, mathematics and computational modeling to develop methods to use new and stored data to the benefit of the patient. We here provide a critical assessment of the opportunities and challenges arising out of systems approaches in medicine and from this provide a definition of what systems medicine entails. Based on our analysis of current developments in medicine and healthcare and associated research needs, we emphasize the role of systems medicine as a multilevel and multidisciplinary methodological framework for informed data acquisition and interdisciplinary data analysis to extract previously inaccessible knowledge for the benefit of patients. Creating specialised computer systems to integrate big data from multiple sources may help provide tailored future healthcare. A healthcare system that meets the needs of every individual needs the ability to collect and mine data precisely and efficiently. Olaf Wolkenhauer at Rostock University, Germany and co-workers have explored the requirements for developing this ‘systems medicine’ approach. Interdisciplinary teams should be established specifically to develop software, computational models and integrated datasets for use in healthcare. Being able to harness information from huge medical datasets could dramatically improve our understanding of disease, and allow scientists to examine illnesses from the molecular scale to whole body responses. Systems medicine could also allow doctors to investigate an individual\\'s specific needs, trial treatments through computer models, and analyze data captured on patients\\' smartphones, to provide safer, more personalised heathcare. Novel copy-number variations in pharmacogenes contribute to interindividual differences in drug pharmacokinetics Variability in pharmacokinetics and drug response is shaped by single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as copy-number variants (CNVs) in genes with importance for drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). While SNVs have been extensively studied, a systematic assessment of the CNV landscape in ADME genes is lacking. We integrated data from 2,504 whole genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 59,898 exomes from the Exome Aggregation Consortium to identify CNVs in 208 relevant pharmacogenes. We describe novel exonic deletions and duplications in 201 (97%) of the pharmacogenes analyzed. The deletions are population-specific and frequencies range from singletons up to 1%, accounting for >5% of all loss-of-function alleles in up to 42% of the genes studied. We experimentally confirmed novel deletions in CYP2C19, CYP4F2, and SLCO1B3 by Sanger sequencing and validated their allelic frequencies in selected populations. CNVs are an additional source of pharmacogenetic variability with important implications for drug response and personalized therapy. This, together with the important contribution of rare alleles to the variability of pharmacogenes, emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive next-generation sequencing–based genotype identification for an accurate prediction of the genetic variability of drug pharmacokinetics. Serum lipidomics reveals early differential effects of gastric bypass compared with banding on phospholipids and sphingolipids independent of differences in weight loss BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Circulating phospholipids and sphingolipids are implicated in obesity related- comorbidities such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. How bariatric surgery affects these important lipid markers is poorly understood. We sought to determine whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which is associated with greater metabolic improvement, differentially affects the phosphosphingolipidome compared to adjustable gastric banding (AGB). SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fasting sera were available from 59 obese women (BMI range 37–51\\u2009kg/m2; n=37 RYGB and 22 AGB) before surgery, then at 1 (21 RYGB, 12 AGB) and 3 months follow-up (19 RYGB, 12 AGB). HPLC-MS/MS was used to quantify 131 lipids from 9 structural classes. DXA measurements and laboratory parameters were also obtained. The associations between lipids and clinical measurements were studied with P-values adjusted for the false discovery rate (fdr). RESULTS: Both surgical procedures rapidly induced weight loss and improved clinical profiles, with RYGB producing better improvements in fat mass, and serum TC, LDL-C, and orosomucoid (fdr<10%). Ninety-three (of 131) lipids were altered by surgery—the majority decreasing—with 29 lipids differentially affected by RYGB during the study period. The differential effect of the surgeries remained statistically significant for 20 of these lipids after adjusting for differences in weight loss between surgery types. The RYGB signature consisted of phosphatidylcholine species not exceeding 36 carbons, and ceramides and sphingomyelins containing C22 to C25 fatty acids. RYGB also led to a sustained increase in unsaturated ceramide and sphingomyelin species. The RYGB-specific lipid changes were associated with decreases in body weight, total and LDL-C, orosomucoid and increased HOMA-S (fdr<10%). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant with greater metabolic improvement, RYGB induced early and sustained changes in phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, and ceramides that were independent of greater weight loss. These data suggest that RYGB may specifically alter sphingolipid metabolism, which, in part, could explain the better metabolic outcomes of this surgical procedure. A novel signalling screen demonstrates that CALR mutations activate essential MAPK signalling and facilitate megakaryocyte differentiation Most myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients lacking JAK2 mutations harbour somatic CALR mutations that are thought to activate cytokine signalling although the mechanism is unclear. To identify kinases important for survival of CALR-mutant cells, we developed a novel strategy (KISMET) that utilizes the full range of kinase selectivity data available from each inhibitor and thus takes advantage of off-target noise that limits conventional small-interfering RNA or inhibitor screens. KISMET successfully identified known essential kinases in haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cell lines and identified the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as required for growth of the CALR-mutated MARIMO cells. Expression of mutant CALR in murine or human haematopoietic cell lines was accompanied by myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL)-dependent activation of MAPK signalling, and MPN patients with CALR mutations showed increased MAPK activity in CD34 cells, platelets and megakaryocytes. Although CALR mutations resulted in protein instability and proteosomal degradation, mutant CALR was able to enhance megakaryopoiesis and pro-platelet production from human CD34+ progenitors. These data link aberrant MAPK activation to the MPN phenotype and identify it as a potential therapeutic target in CALR-mutant positive MPNs. A four-gene LincRNA expression signature predicts risk in multiple cohorts of acute myeloid leukemia patients Prognostic gene expression signatures have been proposed as clinical tools to clarify therapeutic options in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these signatures rely on measuring large numbers of genes and often perform poorly when applied to independent cohorts or those with older patients. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of cell identity and oncogenesis, but knowledge of their utility as prognostic markers in AML is limited. Here we analyze transcriptomic data from multiple cohorts of clinically annotated AML patients and report that (i) microarrays designed for coding gene expression can be repurposed to yield robust lincRNA expression data, (ii) some lincRNA genes are located in close proximity to hematopoietic coding genes and show strong expression correlations in AML, (iii) lincRNA gene expression patterns distinguish cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of AML, (iv) lincRNA signatures composed of three or four genes are independent predictors of clinical outcome and further dichotomize survival in European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk groups and (v) an analytical tool based on logistic regression analysis of quantitative PCR measurement of four lincRNA genes (LINC4) can be used to determine risk in AML. Design and synthesis of polyoxometalate-framework materials from cluster precursors Inorganic oxide materials are used in semiconductor electronics, ion exchange, catalysis, coatings, gas sensors and as separation materials. Inorganic oxide materials are used in semiconductor electronics, ion exchange, catalysis, coatings, gas sensors and as separation materials. Inorganic oxide materials are used in semiconductor electronics, ion exchange, catalysis, coatings, gas sensors and as separation materials. Inorganic oxide materials are used in semiconductor electronics, ion exchange, catalysis, coatings, gas sensors and as separation materials. Although their synthesis is well understood, the scope for new materials is reduced because of the stability limits imposed by high-temperature processing and top-down synthetic approaches. In this Review, we describe the derivatization of polyoxometalate (POM) clusters, which enables their assembly into a range of frameworks by use of organic or inorganic linkers. Additionally, bottom-up synthetic approaches can be used to make metal oxide framework materials, and the features of the molecular POM precursors are retained in these structures. Highly robust all-inorganic frameworks can be made using metal-ion linkers, which combine molecular synthetic control without the need for organic components. The resulting frameworks have high stability, and high catalytic, photochemical and electrochemical activity. Conceptually, these inorganic oxide materials bridge the gap between zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and establish a new class of all-inorganic POM frameworks that can be designed using topological and reactivity principles similar to MOFs. In this Review, we explain how polyoxometalate clusters are amenable to molecular control and can be assembled into inorganic frameworks owing to the molecular nature of their building blocks. BET inhibitor resistance emerges from leukaemia stem cells Bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are first-in-class targeted therapies that deliver a new therapeutic opportunity by directly targeting bromodomain proteins that bind acetylated chromatin marks1,2. Early clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia3, and therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms is crucial to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings provide new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukaemia, highlight potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors, and identify strategies that may enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies. Fumarate is an epigenetic modifier that elicits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Mutations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cancers are highly aggressive and metastasize even when small, leading to a very poor clinical outcome. Fumarate, a small molecule metabolite that accumulates in fumarate hydratase-deficient cells, plays a key role in cell transformation, making it a bona fide oncometabolite. Fumarate has been shown to inhibit α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that are involved in DNA and histone demethylation. However, the link between fumarate accumulation, epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that loss of fumarate hydratase and the subsequent accumulation of fumarate in mouse and human cells elicits an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a phenotypic switch associated with cancer initiation, invasion, and metastasis. We demonstrate that fumarate inhibits Tet-mediated demethylation of a regulatory region of the antimetastatic miRNA cluster mir-200ba429, leading to the expression of EMT-related transcription factors and enhanced migratory properties. These epigenetic and phenotypic changes are recapitulated by the incubation of fumarate hydratase-proficient cells with cell-permeable fumarate. Loss of fumarate hydratase is associated with suppression of miR-200 and the EMT signature in renal cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcome. These results imply that loss of fumarate hydratase and fumarate accumulation contribute to the aggressive features of fumarate hydratase-deficient tumours.

Selectivity determinants of GPCR–G-protein binding The selective coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G proteins is critical to trigger the appropriate physiological response. However, the determinants of selective binding have remained elusive. Here we reveal the existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins. Emergent constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity from global temperature variability Equilibrium climate sensitivity—which remains the largest uncertainty in climate projections—is constrained to a ‘likely’ range of 2.2–3.4 K by taking into account the variability of global temperature about long-term historical warming. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the long-term change in global mean surface temperature predicted to occur in response to an instantaneous doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It is an inherently artificial metric, but is nonetheless an important tool when comparing climate models, and a key point of policy discussion. The seemingly intractable range of ECS estimates complicates policy making because the response of the real climate system to the lowest and highest predicted temperature change would translate into radically different policy options. Peter Cox and colleagues now constrain climate models by their ability to simulate observed variations in climate, and conclude that ECS has a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius (°C), which sits towards the middle to lower end of current estimates, and a range of 2.2–3.4 °C. Importantly, their approach allows them to almost exclude ECS estimates above 4.5 °C or below 1.5 °C. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) remains one of the most important unknowns in climate change science. ECS is defined as the global mean warming that would occur if the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration were instantly doubled and the climate were then brought to equilibrium with that new level of CO2. Despite its rather idealized definition, ECS has continuing relevance for international climate change agreements, which are often framed in terms of stabilization of global warming relative to the pre-industrial climate. However, the ‘likely’ range of ECS as stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has remained at 1.5–4.5 degrees Celsius for more than 25 years1. The possibility of a value of ECS towards the upper end of this range reduces the feasibility of avoiding 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, as required by the Paris Agreement. Here we present a new emergent constraint on ECS that yields a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC ‘likely’ range) of 2.2–3.4 degrees Celsius. Our approach is to focus on the variability of temperature about long-term historical warming, rather than on the warming trend itself. We use an ensemble of climate models to define an emergent relationship2 between ECS and a theoretically informed metric of global temperature variability. This metric of variability can also be calculated from observational records of global warming3, which enables tighter constraints to be placed on ECS, reducing the probability of ECS being less than 1.5 degrees Celsius to less than 3 per cent, and the probability of ECS exceeding 4.5 degrees Celsius to less than 1 per cent. Early loss of Crebbp confers malignant stem cell properties on lymphoid progenitors Loss-of-function mutations of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein, binding protein (CREBBP) are prevalent in lymphoid malignancies. However, the tumour suppressor functions of CREBBP remain unclear. We demonstrate that loss of Crebbp in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to increased development of B-cell lymphomas. This is preceded by accumulation of hyperproliferative lymphoid progenitors with a defective DNA damage response (DDR) due to a failure to acetylate p53. We identify a premalignant lymphoma stem cell population with decreased H3K27ac, which undergoes transcriptional and genetic evolution due to the altered DDR, resulting in lymphomagenesis. Importantly, when Crebbp is lost later in lymphopoiesis, cellular abnormalities are lost and tumour generation is attenuated. We also document that CREBBP mutations may occur in HSPCs from patients with CREBBP-mutated lymphoma. These data suggest that earlier loss of Crebbp is advantageous for lymphoid transformation and inform the cellular origins and subsequent evolution of lymphoid malignancies. Total synthesis and structure–activity relationship studies of a series of selective G protein inhibitors G proteins are key mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, which facilitates a plethora of important physiological processes. The cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are the only known specific inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins; however, no synthetic route has been reported previously for these complex natural products and they are not easily isolated from natural sources. Here we report the first total synthesis of YM-254890 and FR900359, as well as of two known analogues, YM-385780 and YM-385781. The versatility of the synthetic approach also enabled the design and synthesis of ten analogues, which provided the first structure–activity relationship study for this class of compounds. Pharmacological characterization of all the compounds at Gq-, Gi- and Gs-mediated signalling provided succinct information on the structural requirements for inhibition, and demonstrated that both YM-254890 and FR900359 are highly potent inhibitors of Gq signalling, with FR900359 being the most potent. These natural products and their analogues represent unique tools for explorative studies of G protein inhibition. A simple and versatile design concept for fluorophore derivatives with intramolecular photostabilization Intramolecular photostabilization via triple-state quenching was recently revived as a tool to impart synthetic organic fluorophores with ‘self-healing’ properties. To date, utilization of such fluorophore derivatives is rare due to their elaborate multi-step synthesis. Here we present a general strategy to covalently link a synthetic organic fluorophore simultaneously to a photostabilizer and biomolecular target via unnatural amino acids. The modular approach uses commercially available starting materials and simple chemical transformations. The resulting photostabilizer–dye conjugates are based on rhodamines, carbopyronines and cyanines with excellent photophysical properties, that is, high photostability and minimal signal fluctuations. Their versatile use is demonstrated by single-step labelling of DNA, antibodies and proteins, as well as applications in single-molecule and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. We are convinced that the presented scaffolding strategy and the improved characteristics of the conjugates in applications will trigger the broader use of intramolecular photostabilization and help to emerge this approach as a new gold standard. Laboratory observations of slow earthquakes and the spectrum of tectonic fault slip modes Slow earthquakes represent an important conundrum in earthquake physics. While regular earthquakes are catastrophic events with rupture velocities governed by elastic wave speed, the processes that underlie slow fault slip phenomena, including recent discoveries of tremor, slow-slip and low-frequency earthquakes, are less understood. Theoretical models and sparse laboratory observations have provided insights, but the physics of slow fault rupture remain enigmatic. Here we report on laboratory observations that illuminate the mechanics of slow-slip phenomena. We show that a spectrum of slow-slip behaviours arises near the threshold between stable and unstable failure, and is governed by frictional dynamics via the interplay of fault frictional properties, effective normal stress and the elastic stiffness of the surrounding material. This generalizable frictional mechanism may act in concert with other hypothesized processes that damp dynamic ruptures, and is consistent with the broad range of geologic environments where slow earthquakes are observed. Time-programmable drug dosing allows the manipulation, suppression and reversal of antibiotic drug resistance in vitro Multi-drug strategies have been attempted to prolong the efficacy of existing antibiotics, but with limited success. Here we show that the evolution of multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli can be manipulated in vitro by administering pairs of antibiotics and switching between them in ON/OFF manner. Using a multiplexed cell culture system, we find that switching between certain combinations of antibiotics completely suppresses the development of resistance to one of the antibiotics. Using this data, we develop a simple deterministic model, which allows us to predict the fate of multi-drug evolution in this system. Furthermore, we are able to reverse established drug resistance based on the model prediction by modulating antibiotic selection stresses. Our results support the idea that the development of antibiotic resistance may be potentially controlled via continuous switching of drugs. An autonomous organic reaction search engine for chemical reactivity The exploration of chemical space for new reactivity, reactions and molecules is limited by the need for separate work-up-separation steps searching for molecules rather than reactivity. Herein we present a system that can autonomously evaluate chemical reactivity within a network of 64 possible reaction combinations and aims for new reactivity, rather than a predefined set of targets. The robotic system combines chemical handling, in-line spectroscopy and real-time feedback and analysis with an algorithm that is able to distinguish and select the most reactive pathways, generating a reaction selection index (RSI) without need for separate work-up or purification steps. This allows the automatic navigation of a chemical network, leading to previously unreported molecules while needing only to do a fraction of the total possible reactions without any prior knowledge of the chemistry. We show the RSI correlates with reactivity and is able to search chemical space using the most reactive pathways. Genome-scale study reveals reduced metabolic adaptability in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor leading to chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we chart liver metabolic activity and functionality in NAFLD by integrating global transcriptomic data, from human liver biopsies, and metabolic flux data, measured across the human splanchnic vascular bed, within a genome-scale model of human metabolism. We show that an increased amount of liver fat induces mitochondrial metabolism, lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis and a switch from lactate to glycerol as substrate for gluconeogenesis, indicating an intricate balance of exacerbated opposite metabolic processes in glycemic regulation. These changes were associated with reduced metabolic adaptability on a network level in the sense that liver fat accumulation puts increasing demands on the liver to adaptively regulate metabolic responses to maintain basic liver functions. We propose that failure to meet excessive metabolic challenges coupled with reduced metabolic adaptability may lead to a vicious pathogenic cycle leading to the co-morbidities of NAFLD. Large-scale analyses of common and rare variants identify 12 new loci associated with atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation affects more than 33 million people worldwide and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death(1,2). Fourteen genetic loci have been associated with atrial fibrillation in European and Asian ancestry groups(3-7). To further define the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation, we performed large-scale, trans-ancestry meta-analyses of common and rare variant association studies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) included 17,931 individuals with atrial fibrillation and 115,142 referents; the exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) involved 22,346 cases and 132,086 referents. We identified 12 new genetic loci that exceeded genome-wide significance, implicating genes involved in cardiac electrical and structural remodeling. Our results nearly double the number of known genetic loci for atrial fibrillation, provide insights into the molecular basis of atrial fibrillation, and may facilitate the identification of new potential targets for drug discovery(8). Precursory changes in seismic velocity for the spectrum of earthquake failure modes Temporal changes in seismic velocity during the earthquake cycle have the potential to illuminate physical processes associated with fault weakening and connections between the range of fault slip behaviors including slow earthquakes, tremor and low frequency earthquakes1. Laboratory and theoretical studies predict changes in seismic velocity prior to earthquake failure2, however tectonic faults fail in a spectrum of modes and little is known about precursors for those modes3. Here we show that precursory changes of wave speed occur in laboratory faults for the complete spectrum of failure modes observed for tectonic faults. We systematically altered the stiffness of the loading system to reproduce the transition from slow to fast stick-slip and monitored ultrasonic wave speed during frictional sliding. We find systematic variations of elastic properties during the seismic cycle for both slow and fast earthquakes indicating similar physical mechanisms during rupture nucleation. Our data show that accelerated fault creep causes reduction of seismic velocity and elastic moduli during the preparatory phase preceding failure, which suggests that real time monitoring of active faults may be a means to detect earthquake precursors. Tuning the energetics and tailoring the optical properties of silver clusters confined in zeolites The integration of metal atoms and clusters in well-defined dielectric cavities is a powerful strategy to impart new properties to them that depend on the size and geometry of the confined space as well as on metal-host electrostatic interactions. Here, we unravel the dependence of the electronic properties of metal clusters on space confinement by studying the ionization potential of silver clusters embedded in four different zeolite environments over a range of silver concentrations. Extensive characterization reveals a strong influence of silver loading and host environment on the cluster ionization potential, which is also correlated to the cluster\\'s optical and structural properties. Through fine-tuning of the zeolite host environment, we demonstrate photoluminescence quantum yields approaching unity. This work extends our understanding of structure-property relationships of small metal clusters and applies this understanding to develop highly photoluminescent materials with potential applications in optoelectronics and\\xa0bioimaging. ispartof: NATURE MATERIALS vol:15 issue:9 pages:1017-1022 ispartof: location:England status: published A nanomesh scaffold for supramolecular nanowire optoelectronic devices Hundreds of semiconducting supramolecular nanowires are integrated in a photovoltaic device.

Defining the major health modifiers causing atrial fibrillation: a roadmap to underpin personalized prevention and treatment Despite remarkable advances in antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation procedures, and stroke-prevention strategies, atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause of death and disability in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Unstructured management of patients with AF sharply contrasts with our detailed, although incomplete, knowledge of the mechanisms that cause AF and its complications. Altered calcium homeostasis, atrial fibrosis and ageing, ion-channel dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, fat-cell infiltration, and oxidative stress, in addition to a susceptible genetic background, contribute to the promotion, maintenance, and progression of AF. However, clinical management of patients with AF is currently guided by stroke risk parameters, AF pattern, and symptoms. In response to this apparent disconnect between the known pathophysiology of AF and clinical management, we propose a roadmap to develop a set of clinical markers that reflect the major causes of AF in patients. Thereby, the insights into the mechanisms causing AF will be transformed into a format that can underpin future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF, ultimately informing better patient care. Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of exercise-induced arrhythmias The cardiovascular benefits of physical activity are indisputable. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that both atrial fibrillation and right ventricular arrhythmia can be caused by intense exercise in some individuals. Exercise-induced atrial fibrillation is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged, otherwise healthy men who have been engaged in endurance training for >10 years, and is mediated by atrial dilatation, parasympathetic enhancement, and possibly atrial fibrosis. Cardiac ablation is evolving as a first-line tool for athletes with exercise-induced arrhythmia who are eager to remain active. The relationship between physical activity and right ventricular arrhythmia is complex and involves genetic and physical factors that, in a few athletes, eventually lead to right ventricular dilatation, followed by subsequent myocardial fibrosis and lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction blocks are common in athletes, most of whom remain asymptomatic, although incomplete reversibility has been shown after exercise cessation. In this Review, we summarize the evidence supporting the existence of exercise-induced arrhythmias and discuss the specific considerations for the clinical management of these patients. Trends in GPCR drug discovery: new agents, targets and indications G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets, mostly due to their substantial involvement in human pathophysiology and their pharmacological tractability. Here, we report an up-to-date analysis of all GPCR drugs and agents in clinical trials, which reveals current trends across molecule types, drug targets and therapeutic indications, including showing that 475 drugs (~34% of all drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) act at 108 unique GPCRs. Approximately 321 agents are currently in clinical trials, of which ~20% target 66 potentially novel GPCR targets without an approved drug, and the number of biological drugs, allosteric modulators and biased agonists has increased. The major disease indications for GPCR modulators show a shift towards diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer disease, although several central nervous system disorders are also highly represented. The 224 (56%) non-olfactory GPCRs that have not yet been explored in clinical trials have broad untapped therapeutic potential, particularly in genetic and immune system disorders. Finally, we provide an interactive online resource to analyse and infer trends in GPCR drug discovery. Global burden of NAFLD and NASH: trends, predictions, risk factors and prevention NAFLD is one of the most important causes of liver disease worldwide and will probably emerge as the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the coming decades, with the disease affecting both adults and children. The epidemiology and demographic characteristics of NAFLD vary worldwide, usually parallel to the prevalence of obesity, but a substantial proportion of patients are lean. The large number of patients with NAFLD with potential for progressive liver disease creates challenges for screening, as the diagnosis of NASH necessitates invasive liver biopsy. Furthermore, individuals with NAFLD have a high frequency of metabolic comorbidities and could place a growing strain on health-care systems from their need for management. While awaiting the development effective therapies, this disease warrants the attention of primary care physicians, specialists and health policy makers. PNPLA3 and obesity: a synergistic relationship in NAFLD NAFLD, the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, is a multifactorial condition — environmental factors influence an inherited genetic risk. Stender et al. now describe the additive effect of obesity and NAFLD-associated genetic polymorphisms on steatosis, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels and cirrhosis, remarkably illustrating the principle of gene–environment interactions. Prediction of antibiotic resistance: time for a new preclinical paradigm? Predicting the future is difficult, especially for evolutionary processes that are influenced by numerous unknown factors. Still, this is what is required of drug developers when they assess the risk of resistance arising against a new antibiotic candidate during preclinical development. In this Opinion article, we argue that the traditional procedures that are used for the prediction of antibiotic resistance today could be markedly improved by including a broader analysis of bacterial fitness, infection dynamics, horizontal gene transfer and other factors. This will lead to more informed preclinical decisions for continuing or discontinuing the development of drug candidates. Fluid biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury and related conditions Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as concussion, remain a major unmet clinical need. Moderate to severe TBI can be diagnosed definitively by clinical assessment and standard neuroimaging techniques that detect the gross damage to the brain parenchyma. Diagnostic tools for mild TBI are lacking and, currently, the diagnosis has to be made on clinical grounds alone, because most patients show no gross pathological changes on CT. Most patients with mild TBI recover quickly, but about 15% develop an ill-defined condition called postconcussive syndrome (PCS). Repeated concussions have been associated with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only currently be diagnosed post mortem. Fluid biomarkers are needed to better define and detect mild TBI and related conditions. Here, we review the literature on fluid biomarkers for neuronal, axonal, oligodendrocytic, astroglial and blood-brain barrier injury, as well as markers for neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation, in the context of mild TBI, PCS and CTE. We also discuss technical and standardization issues and potential pathways to advance the most promising biomarker candidates into clinical laboratory practice. Preventing progression from arthralgia to arthritis: targeting the right patients Early treatment is associated with improved outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suggesting that a \\'window of opportunity\\', in which the disease is most susceptible to disease-modifying treatment, exists. Autoantibodies and markers of systemic inflammation can be present long before clinical arthritis, and maturation of the immune response seems to coincide with the development of RA. The pre-arthritis phase associated with symptoms such as as joint pain without clinical arthritis (athralgia) is now hypothesized to fall within the aforementioned window of opportunity. Consequently, disease modulation in this phase might prevent the occurrence of clinically apparent arthritis, which would result in a persistent disease course if untreated. Several ongoing proof-of-concept trials are now testing this hypothesis. This Review highlights the importance of adequate risk prediction for the correct design, execution and interpretation of results of these prevention trials, as well as considerations when translating these findings into clinical practice. The patients\\' perspectives are discussed, and the accuracy with which RA development can be predicted in patients presenting with arthralgia is evaluated. Currently, the best starting position for preventive studies is proposed to be the inclusion of patients with an increased risk of RA, such as those identified as fulfilling the EULAR definition of \\'arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA\\'. Functional interdependence of BRD4 and DOT1L in MLL leukemia Targeted therapies against disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, the mechanisms by which BRD4 and DOT1L regulate leukemogenic transcription programs remain unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, chemoproteomics and biochemical fractionation, we found that native BRD4 and DOT1L exist in separate protein complexes. Genetic disruption or small-molecule inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L showed marked synergistic activity against MLL leukemia cell lines, primary human leukemia cells and mouse leukemia models. Mechanistically, we found a previously unrecognized functional collaboration between DOT1L and BRD4 that is especially important at highly transcribed genes in proximity to superenhancers. DOT1L, via dimethylated histone H3 K79, facilitates histone H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4 to chromatin. These data provide new insights into the regulation of transcription and specify a molecular framework for therapeutic intervention in this disease with poor prognosis. Diels–Alder polymerization: a versatile synthetic method toward functional polyphenylenes, ladder polymers and graphene nanoribbons The Diels–Alder reaction has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry since its discovery in 1928. The catalyst-free nature, functional group tolerance and high efficiency of the Diels–Alder reaction also make it promising for the fabrication of functional polymeric materials. In particular, a large variety of functional polyphenylenes (polymer structures mainly consisting of phenylenes) and ladder polymers (double-stranded polymers with periodic linkages connecting the strands) have been obtained by this method, offering potential applications such as polymer electrolyte membranes and gas separation. More recently, tailor-made polyphenylenes prepared by Diels–Alder polymerization have been used as precursors of structurally well-defined graphene nanoribbons (ribbon-shaped nanometer-wide graphene segments) with different widths, exhibiting long lengths (>600\\u2009nm) and tunable electronic bandgaps. This article provides a comprehensive review of the use of Diels–Alder polymerization to build functional polyphenylenes, ladder polymers and graphene nanoribbons. In this review, we summarize the use of Diels–Alder reaction in the synthesis of arylene-based polymers, including polyphenylenes and ladder polymers, as well as graphene nanoribbons. These polymer materials are structurally related to each other, but rarely discussed all together in a same context. The importance and versatility of the Diels–Alder polymerization is highlighted for the synthesis of such polymers with various potential applications, for example, as polymer electrolyte membrane and organic semiconductors. Gut microbiota structure differs between honeybees in winter and summer Adult honeybees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over 2 years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data show that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift toward high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease. An optimized prediction framework to assess the functional impact of pharmacogenetic variants Prediction of phenotypic consequences of mutations constitutes an important aspect of precision medicine. Current computational tools mostly rely on evolutionary conservation and have been calibrated on variants associated with disease, which poses conceptual problems for assessment of variants in poorly conserved pharmacogenes. Here, we evaluated the performance of 18 current functionality prediction methods leveraging experimental high-quality activity data from 337 variants in genes involved in drug metabolism and transport and found that these models only achieved probabilities of 0.1–50.6% to make informed conclusions. We therefore developed a functionality prediction framework optimized for pharmacogenetic assessments that significantly outperformed current algorithms. Our model achieved 93% for both sensitivity and specificity for both loss-of-function and functionally neutral variants, and we confirmed its superior performance using cross validation analyses. This novel model holds promise to improve the translation of personal genetic information into biological conclusions and pharmacogenetic recommendations, thereby facilitating the implementation of Next-Generation Sequencing data into clinical diagnostics. Plasma neurofilament light chain concentration is increased in anorexia nervosa Abstract Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with high mortality and, to a large extent, unknown pathophysiology. Structural brain differences, such as global or focal reductions in grey or white matter volumes, as well as enlargement of the sulci and the ventricles, have repeatedly been observed in individuals with AN. However, many of the documented aberrances normalize with weight recovery, even though some studies show enduring changes. To further explore whether AN is associated with neuronal damage, we analysed the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker reflecting ongoing neuronal injury, in plasma samples from females with AN, females recovered from AN (AN-REC) and normal-weight age-matched female controls (CTRLS). We detected significantly increased plasma levels of NfL in AN vs CTRLS (medianAN\\u2009=\\u200915.6\\u2009pg/ml, IQRAN\\u2009=\\u200912.1–21.3, medianCTRL\\u2009=\\u20099.3\\u2009pg/ml, IQRCTRL\\u2009=\\u20096.4–12.9, and p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), AN vs AN-REC (medianAN-REC\\u2009=\\u200911.1\\u2009pg/ml, IQRAN-REC\\u2009=\\u20098.6–15.5, and p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), and AN-REC vs CTRLS (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). The plasma levels of NfL are negatively associated with BMI overall samples (β (±se)\\u2009=\\u2009−0.62\\u2009±\\u20090.087 and p\\u2009=\\u20096.9‧10−12). This indicates that AN is associated with neuronal damage that partially normalizes with weight recovery. Further studies are needed to determine which brain areas are affected, and potential long-term sequelae. A new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the glycan loop of Zika virus envelope protein Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) infection poses a serious threat to human health. However, no licensed vaccine or therapeutic drug is currently available for ZIKV. We have previously shown that recombinant ZIKV E80 protein induced potent neutralizing antibody response and protected mice from lethal viral challenge. In the present study, we isolated five ZIKV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from E80-immunized mice. These five mAbs specifically bound and neutralized Asian-lineage ZIKV strains. Epitope mapping revealed that all of the five mAbs recognized a novel linear epitope located on the glycan loop of E protein domain I. Sequence alignment revealed that the epitope was extremely conserved in ZIKV but highly variable between ZIKV and other flaviviruses. Thus, these five mAbs form a new class of anti-ZIKV antibodies exhibiting broad-spectrum neutralization on Asian-lineage ZIKV. A representative of this mAb class, 5F8, was found to exert inhibitory function in vitro primarily at the early stage of the post-attachment viral entry process. Importantly, mAb 5F8 was able to confer full protection in a mouse model of ZIKV lethal infection. Our results have strong implications for developing anti-ZIKV vaccines and therapeutic mAbs. Differential transmission of Asian and African Zika virus lineages by Aedes aegypti from New Caledonia International audience; Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus that is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV is divided into two phylogenetic lineages, African and Asian. In the Asian lineage, Pacific and American clades have been linked to the recent worldwide outbreak of ZIKV. The aim of this study was to measure the vector competence of Aedes aegypti for seven ZIKV strains belonging to both lineages. We demonstrate that Ae. aegypti from New Caledonia (NC), South Pacific region, is a low-competence vector for Asian ZIKV (<10% transmission efficiency). No significant differences were observed in vector competence with respect to the sampling date and collection site of Asian ZIKV strains used (2014 and 2015 for New Caledonia, Pacific clade, and 2016 for French Guiana, American clade). The ability of the New Caledonian Ae. aegypti to transmit ZIKV is significantly greater for the earlier viral isolates belonging to the African lineage (>37% transmission efficiency after 9 days post-infection) compared to recent ZIKV isolates from African (10% transmission efficiency) and Asian lineages (<10% transmission efficiency). The results of this study demonstrate that Ae. aegypti from NC can become infected and replicate different ZIKV strains belonging to all lineages. Our data emphasize the importance of studying the interaction between vectors and their arboviruses according to each local geographic context. This approach will improve our understanding of arbovirus transmission to prevent their emergence and improve health surveillance. Potential of Aedes albopictus as a bridge vector for enzootic pathogens at the urban-forest interface in Brazil The invasive species Aedes albopictus is present in 60% of Brazilian municipalities, including at the interfaces between urban settings and forests that are zoonotic arbovirus hotspots. We investigated Ae. albopictus colonization, adult dispersal and host feeding patterns in the anthropic-natural interface of three forested sites covering three biomes in Brazil in 2016. To evaluate whether an ecological overlap exists between Ae. albopictus and sylvatic yellow fever virus (YFV) in forests, we performed similar investigations in seven additional urban-forest interfaces where YFV circulated in 2017. We found Ae. albopictus in all forested sites. We detected eggs and adults up to 300 and 500 m into the forest, respectively, demonstrating that Ae. albopictus forest colonization and dispersal decrease with distance from the forest edge. Analysis of the host identity in blood-engorged females indicated that they fed mainly on humans and domestic mammals, suggesting rare contact with wildlife at the forest edge. Our results show that Ae. albopictus frequency declines as it penetrates into the forest and highlight its potential role as a bridge vector of zoonotic diseases at the edge of the Brazilian forests studied. Frequencies of clinically important CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles are graded across Europe CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are important drug-metabolizing enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of around 30% of all medications. Importantly, the corresponding genes are highly polymorphic and these genetic differences contribute to interindividual and interethnic differences in drug pharmacokinetics, response, and toxicity. In this study we systematically analyzed the frequency distribution of clinically relevant CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles across Europe based on data from 82,791 healthy individuals extracted from 79 original publications and, for the first time, provide allele confidence intervals for the general population. We found that frequencies of CYP2D6 gene duplications showed a clear South-East to North-West gradient ranging from <1% in Sweden and Denmark to 6% in Greece and Turkey. In contrast, an inverse distribution was observed for the loss-of-function alleles CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5. Similarly, frequencies of the inactive CYP2C19*2 allele were graded from North-West to South-East Europe. In important contrast to previous work we found that the increased activity allele CYP2C19*17 was most prevalent in Central Europe (25–33%) with lower prevalence in Mediterranean-South Europeans (11–24%). In summary, we provide a detailed European map of common CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 variants and find that frequencies of the most clinically relevant alleles are geographically graded reflective of Europe’s migratory history. These findings emphasize the importance of generating pharmacogenomic data sets with high spatial resolution to improve precision public health across Europe. Impact of NUDT15 genetics on severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in patients with European ancestry Purpose Severe hematotoxicity in patients with thiopurine therapy has been associated with genetic polymorphisms in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). While TPMT genetic testing is clinically implemented for dose individualization, alterations in the nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) emerged as independent determinant of thiopurine-related hematotoxicity. Because data for European patients are limited, we investigated the relevance of NUDT15 in Europeans. Methods Additionally to TPMT phenotyping/genotyping, we performed in-depth Sanger sequencing analyses of NUDT15 coding region in 107 European patients who developed severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity as extreme phenotype. Moreover, genotyping for NUDT15 variants in 689 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients was performed. Results As expected TPMT was the main cause of severe hematotoxicity in 31% of patients, who were either TPMT deficient (10%) or heterozygous carriers of TPMT variants (21%). By comparison, NUDT15 genetic polymorphism was identified in 14 (13%) patients including one novel variant (p.Met1Ile). Six percent of patients with severe toxicity carried variants in both TPMT and NUDT15. Among patients who developed toxicity within 3 months of treatment, 13% were found to be carriers of NUDT15 variants. Conclusion Taken together, NUDT15 and TPMT genetics explain ~50% of severe thiopurine-related hematotoxicity, providing a compelling rationale for additional preemptive testing of NUDT15 genetics not only in Asians, but also in Europeans. Autonomous model protocell division driven by molecular replication The coupling of compartmentalisation with molecular replication is thought to be crucial for the emergence of the first evolvable chemical systems. Minimal artificial replicators have been designed based on molecular recognition, inspired by the template copying of DNA, but none yet have been coupled to compartmentalisation. Here, we present an oil-in-water droplet system comprising an amphiphilic imine dissolved in chloroform that catalyses its own formation by bringing together a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic precursor, which leads to repeated droplet division. We demonstrate that the presence of the amphiphilic replicator, by lowering the interfacial tension between droplets of the reaction mixture and the aqueous phase, causes them to divide. Periodic sampling by a droplet-robot demonstrates that the extent of fission is increased as the reaction progresses, producing more compartments with increased self-replication. This bridges a divide, showing how replication at the molecular level can be used to drive macroscale droplet fission. Biochemical mechanisms determine the functional compatibility of heterologous genes Elucidating the factors governing the functional compatibility of horizontally transferred genes is important to understand bacterial evolution, including the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, and to successfully engineer biological systems. In silico efforts and work using single-gene libraries have suggested that sequence composition is a strong barrier for the successful integration of heterologous genes. Here we sample 200 diverse genes, representing >80% of sequenced antibiotic resistance genes, to interrogate the factors governing genetic compatibility in new hosts. In contrast to previous work, we find that GC content, codon usage, and mRNA-folding energy are of minor importance for the compatibility of mechanistically diverse gene products at moderate expression. Instead, we identify the phylogenetic origin, and the dependence of a resistance mechanism on host physiology, as major factors governing the functionality and fitness of antibiotic resistance genes. These findings emphasize the importance of biochemical mechanism for heterologous gene compatibility, and suggest physiological constraints as a pivotal feature orienting the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Formalising recall by genotype as an efficient approach to detailed phenotyping and causal inference Detailed phenotyping is required to deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind genetic associations. In addition, the impact of potentially modifiable risk factors on disease requires analytical frameworks that allow causal inference. Here, we discuss the characteristics of Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) as a study design aimed at addressing both these needs. We describe two broad scenarios for the application of RbG: studies using single variants and those using multiple variants. We consider the efficacy and practicality of the RbG approach, provide a catalogue of UK-based resources for such studies and present an online RbG study planner. Quantifying climate feedbacks in polar regions The concept of feedback is key in assessing whether a perturbation to a system is amplified or damped by mechanisms internal to the system. In polar regions, climate dynamics are controlled by both radiative and non-radiative interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets and land surfaces. Precisely quantifying polar feedbacks is required for a process-oriented evaluation of climate models, a clear understanding of the processes responsible for polar climate changes, and a reduction in uncertainty associated with model projections. This quantification can be performed using a simple and consistent approach that is valid for a wide range of feedbacks, offering the opportunity for more systematic feedback analyses and a better understanding of polar climate changes. DNA methylation as a mediator of HLA-DRB1*15:01 and a protective variant in multiple sclerosis The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype DRB1*15:01 is the major risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we find that DRB1*15:01 is hypomethylated and predominantly expressed in monocytes among carriers of DRB1*15:01. A differentially methylated region (DMR) encompassing HLA-DRB1 exon 2 is particularly affected and displays methylation-sensitive regulatory properties in vitro. Causal inference and Mendelian randomization provide evidence that HLA variants mediate risk for MS via changes in the HLA-DRB1 DMR that modify HLA-DRB1 expression. Meta-analysis of 14,259 cases and 171,347 controls confirms that these variants confer risk from DRB1*15:01 and also identifies a protective variant (rs9267649, p\\u2009<\\u20093.32\\u2009×\\u200910−8, odds ratio\\u2009=\\u20090.86) after conditioning for all MS-associated variants in the region. rs9267649 is associated with increased DNA methylation at the HLA-DRB1 DMR and reduced expression of HLA-DRB1, suggesting a modulation of the DRB1*15:01 effect. Our integrative approach provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of MS susceptibility and suggests putative therapeutic strategies targeting a methylation-mediated regulation of the major risk gene. Skilful forecasting of global fire activity using seasonal climate predictions Societal exposure to large fires has been increasing in recent years. Estimating the expected fire activity a few months in advance would allow reducing environmental and socio-economic impacts through short-term adaptation and response to climate variability and change. However, seasonal prediction of climate-driven fires is still in its infancy. Here, we discuss a strategy for seasonally forecasting burned area anomalies linking seasonal climate predictions with parsimonious empirical climate–fire models using the standardized precipitation index as the climate predictor for burned area. Assuming near-perfect climate predictions, we obtained skilful predictions of fire activity over a substantial portion of the global burnable area (~60%). Using currently available operational seasonal climate predictions, the skill of fire seasonal forecasts remains high and significant in a large fraction of the burnable area (~40%). These findings reveal an untapped and useful burned area predictive ability using seasonal climate forecasts, which can play a crucial role in fire management strategies and minimise the impact of adverse climate conditions. Determinants of promoter and enhancer transcription directionality in metazoans Divergent transcription from promoters and enhancers is pervasive in many species, but it remains unclear if it is a general feature of all eukaryotic cis regulatory elements. To address this, here we define cis regulatory elements in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens and investigate the determinants of their transcription directionality. In all three species, we find that divergent transcription is initiated from two separate core promoter sequences and promoter regions display competition between histone modifications on the\\u2009+\\u20091 and −1 nucleosomes. In contrast, promoter directionality, sequence composition surrounding promoters, and positional enrichment of chromatin states, are different across species. Integrative models of H3K4me3 levels and core promoter sequence are highly predictive of promoter and enhancer directionality and support two directional classes, skewed and balanced. The relative importance of features to these models are clearly distinct for promoters and enhancers. Differences in regulatory architecture within and between metazoans are therefore abundant, arguing against a unified eukaryotic model. A recent increase in global wave power as a consequence of oceanic warming Wind-generated ocean waves drive important coastal processes that determine flooding and erosion. Ocean warming has been one factor affecting waves globally. Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator. Genomic diversity landscape of the honey bee gut microbiota The structure and distribution of genomic diversity in natural microbial communities is largely unexplored. Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to assess the diversity of the honey bee gut microbiota, a community consisting of few bacterial phylotypes. Our results show that most phylotypes are composed of sequence-discrete populations, which co-exist in individual bees and show age-specific abundance profiles. In contrast, strains present within these sequence-discrete populations were found to segregate into individual bees. Consequently, despite a conserved phylotype composition, each honey bee harbors a distinct community at the functional level. While ecological differentiation seems to facilitate coexistence at higher taxonomic levels, our findings suggest that, at the level of strains, priority effects during community assembly result in individualized profiles, despite the social lifestyle of the host. Our study underscores the need to move beyond phylotype-level characterizations to understand the function of this community, and illustrates its potential for strain-level analysis. Collateral sensitivity constrains resistance evolution of the CTX-M-15 β-lactamase Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge to global public health. Discovery of new antibiotics is slow and to ensure proper treatment of bacterial infections new strategies are needed. One way to curb the development of antibiotic resistance is to design drug combinations where the development of resistance against one drug leads to collateral sensitivity to the other drug. Here we study collateral sensitivity patterns of the globally distributed extended-spectrum β-lactamase CTX-M-15, and find three non-synonymous mutations with increased resistance against mecillinam or piperacillin–tazobactam that simultaneously confer full susceptibility to several cephalosporin drugs. We show in vitro and in mice that a combination of mecillinam and cefotaxime eliminates both wild-type and resistant CTX-M-15. Our results indicate that mecillinam and cefotaxime in combination constrain resistance evolution of CTX-M-15, and illustrate how drug combinations can be rationally designed to limit the resistance evolution of horizontally transferred genes by exploiting collateral sensitivity patterns. Towards reliable extreme weather and climate event attribution Climate change is shaping extreme heat and rain. To what degree human activity has increased the risk of high impact events is of high public concern and still heavily debated. Recent studies attributed single extreme events to climate change by comparing climate model experiments where the influence of an external driver can be included or artificially suppressed. Many of these results however did not properly account for model errors in simulating the probabilities of extreme event occurrences. Here we show, exploiting advanced correction techniques from the weather forecasting field, that correcting properly for model probabilities alters the attributable risk of extreme events to climate change. This study illustrates the need to correct for this type of model error in order to provide trustworthy assessments of climate change impacts. A systems biology approach uncovers cell-specific gene regulatory effects of genetic associations in multiple sclerosis Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50,000 unique associations with common human traits. While this represents a substantial step forward, establishing the biology underlying these associations has proven extremely difficult. Even determining which cell types and which particular gene(s) are relevant continues to be a challenge. Here, we conduct a cell-specific pathway analysis of the latest GWAS in multiple sclerosis (MS), which had analyzed a total of 47,351 cases and 68,284 healthy controls and found more than 200 non-MHC genome-wide associations. Our analysis identifies pan immune cell as well as cell-specific susceptibility genes in T cells, B cells and monocytes. Finally, genotype-level data from 2,370 patients and 412 controls is used to compute intra-individual and cell-specific susceptibility pathways that offer a biological interpretation of the individual genetic risk to MS. This approach could be adopted in any other complex trait for which genome-wide data is available. ZIKV infection induces robust Th1-like Tfh cell and long-term protective antibody responses in immunocompetent mice Induction of long-lived antibody responses during infection or vaccination is often essential for subsequent protection, but the relative contributions of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and\\xa0T helper 1 (Th1) cells for induction of antigen specific antibody responses to viruses are unclear. Here, we establish an acute Zika virus (ZIKV) infection model in immunocompetent mice, and show that ZIKV infection elicits robust Th1-like Tfh cell and protective antibody responses. While these Th1-like Tfh cells share phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles with both Tfh and Th1 cells, they also have unique surface markers and gene expression characteristics, and are dependent on T-bet for their development. Th1-like Tfh cells, but not Th1 cells, are essential for class switching of ZIKV-specific IgG2c antibodies and maintenance of long-term neutralizing antibody responses. Our study suggests that specific modulation of the Th1-like Tfh cell response during infection or vaccination may augment the induction of antiviral antibody response to ZIKV and other viruses. Vimentin filaments interact with the actin cortex in mitosis allowing normal cell division The vimentin network displays remarkable plasticity to support basic cellular functions and reorganizes during cell division. Here, we show that in several cell types vimentin filaments redistribute to the cell cortex during mitosis, forming a robust framework interwoven with cortical actin and affecting its organization. Importantly, the intrinsically disordered tail domain of vimentin is essential for this redistribution, which allows normal mitotic progression. A tailless vimentin mutant forms curly bundles, which remain entangled with dividing chromosomes leading to mitotic catastrophes or asymmetric partitions. Serial deletions of vimentin tail domain gradually impair cortical association and mitosis progression. Disruption of f-actin, but not of microtubules, causes vimentin bundling near the chromosomes. Pathophysiological stimuli, including HIV-protease and lipoxidation, induce similar alterations. Interestingly, full filament formation is dispensable for cortical association, which also occurs in vimentin particles. These results unveil implications of vimentin dynamics in cell division through its interplay with the actin cortex. Restoration of visual function by transplantation of optogenetically engineered photoreceptors A major challenge in the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases, with the transplantation of replacement photoreceptors, is the difficulty in inducing the grafted cells to grow and maintain light sensitive outer segments in the host retina, which depends on proper interaction with the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Here, for an RPE-independent treatment approach, we introduce a hyperpolarizing microbial opsin into photoreceptor precursors from newborn mice, and transplant them into blind mice lacking the photoreceptor layer. These optogenetically-transformed photoreceptors are light responsive and their transplantation leads to the recovery of visual function, as shown by ganglion cell recordings and behavioral tests. Subsequently, we generate cone photoreceptors from human induced pluripotent stem cells, expressing the chloride pump Jaws. After transplantation into blind mice, we observe light-driven responses at the photoreceptor and ganglion cell levels. These results demonstrate that structural and functional retinal repair is possible by combining stem cell therapy and optogenetics. East Greenland ice core dust record reveals timing of Greenland ice sheet advance and retreat Accurate estimates of the past extent of the Greenland ice sheet provide critical constraints for ice sheet models used to determine Greenland’s response to climate forcing and contribution to global sea level. Here we use a continuous ice core dust record from the Renland ice cap on the east coast of Greenland to constrain the timing of changes to the ice sheet margin and relative sea level over the last glacial cycle. During the Holocene and the previous interglacial period (Eemian) the dust record was dominated by coarse particles consistent with rock samples from central East Greenland. From the coarse particle concentration record we infer the East Greenland ice sheet margin advanced from 113.4\\u2009±\\u20090.4 to 111.0\\u2009±\\u20090.4 ka BP during the glacial onset and retreated from 12.1\\u2009±\\u20090.1 to 9.0\\u2009±\\u20090.1 ka BP during the last deglaciation. These findings constrain the possible response of the Greenland ice sheet to climate forcings. Environmental co-benefits and adverse side-effects of alternative power sector decarbonization strategies A rapid and deep decarbonization of power supply worldwide is required to limit global warming to well below 2\\u2009°C. Beyond greenhouse gas emissions, the power sector is also responsible for numerous other environmental impacts. Here we combine scenarios from integrated assessment models with a\\xa0forward-looking life-cycle assessment to explore how alternative technology choices in power sector decarbonization pathways compare in terms of non-climate environmental impacts at the system level. While all decarbonization pathways yield major environmental co-benefits, we find that the scale of co-benefits as well as profiles of adverse side-effects depend strongly on technology choice. Mitigation scenarios focusing on wind and solar power are more effective in reducing human health impacts compared to those with low renewable energy, while inducing a more pronounced shift away from fossil and toward mineral resource depletion. Conversely, non-climate ecosystem damages are highly uncertain but tend to increase, chiefly due to land requirements for bioenergy. Analysis of polarimetric satellite measurements suggests stronger cooling due to aerosol-cloud interactions Anthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to an increase in the amount of cloud condensation nuclei and consequently an increase in cloud droplet number concentration and cloud albedo. The corresponding negative radiative forcing due to aerosol cloud interactions (RFaci) is one of the most uncertain radiative forcing terms as reported in the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Here we show that previous observation-based studies underestimate aerosol-cloud interactions because they used measurements of aerosol optical properties that are not directly related to cloud formation and are hampered by measurement uncertainties. We have overcome this problem by the use of new polarimetric satellite retrievals of the relevant aerosol properties (aerosol number, size, shape). The resulting estimate of RFaci = −1.14 Wm−2 (range between −0.84 and −1.72 Wm−2) is more than a factor 2 stronger than the IPCC estimate that includes also other aerosol induced changes in cloud properties. Slow-to-fast transition of giant creeping rockslides modulated by undrained loading in basal shear zones Giant rockslides are widespread and sensitive to hydrological forcing, especially in climate change scenarios. They creep slowly for centuries and then can fail catastrophically posing major threats to society. However, the mechanisms regulating the slow-to-fast transition toward their catastrophic collapse remain elusive. We couple laboratory experiments on natural rockslide shear zone material and in situ observations to provide a scale-independent demonstration that short-term pore fluid pressure variations originate a full spectrum of creep styles, modulated by slip-induced undrained conditions. Shear zones respond to pore pressure increments by impulsive acceleration and dilatancy, causing spontaneous deceleration followed by sustained steady-rate creep. Increasing pore pressure results in high creep rates and eventual collapse. Laboratory experiments quantitatively capture the in situ behavior of giant rockslides and lay physically-based foundations to understand the collapse of giant rockslides. Predicting gene expression using morphological cell responses to nanotopography Cells respond in complex ways to their environment, making it challenging to predict a direct relationship between the two. A key problem is the lack of informative representations of parameters that translate directly into biological function. Here we present a platform to relate the effects of cell morphology to gene expression induced by nanotopography. This platform utilizes the ‘morphome’, a multivariate dataset of cell morphology parameters. We create a Bayesian linear regression model that uses the morphome to robustly predict changes in bone, cartilage, muscle and fibrous gene expression induced by nanotopography. Furthermore, through this model we effectively predict nanotopography-induced gene expression from a complex co-culture microenvironment. The information from the morphome uncovers previously unknown effects of nanotopography on altering cell–cell interaction and osteogenic gene expression at the single cell level. The predictive relationship between morphology and gene expression arising from cell-material interaction shows promise for exploration of new topographies. Translational learning from clinical studies predicts drug pharmacokinetics across patient populations Early indication of late-stage failure of novel candidate drugs could be facilitated by continuous integration, assessment, and transfer of knowledge acquired along pharmaceutical development programs. We here present a translational systems pharmacology workflow that combines drug cocktail probing in a specifically designed clinical study, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, and Bayesian statistics to identify and transfer (patho-)physiological and drug-specific knowledge across distinct patient populations. Our work builds on two clinical investigations, one with 103 healthy volunteers and one with 79 diseased patients from which we systematically derived physiological information from pharmacokinetic data for a reference probe drug (midazolam) at the single-patient level. Taking into account the acquired knowledge describing (patho-)physiological alterations in the patient cohort allowed the successful prediction of the population pharmacokinetics of a second, candidate probe drug (torsemide) in the patient population. In addition, we identified significant relations of the acquired physiological processes to patient metadata from liver biopsies. The presented prototypical systems pharmacology approach is a proof of concept for model-based translation across different stages of pharmaceutical development programs. Applied consistently, it has the potential to systematically improve predictivity of pharmacokinetic simulations by incorporating the results of clinical trials and translating them to subsequent studies. Arctic sea-ice change tied to its mean state through thermodynamic processes One of the clearest manifestations of ongoing global climate change is the dramatic retreat and thinning of the Arctic sea-ice cover. While all state-of-the-art climate models consistently reproduce the sign of these changes, they largely disagree on their magnitude the reasons for which remain contentious. As such, consensual methods to reduce uncertainty in projections are lacking. Here, using the CMIP ensemble, we propose a process-oriented approach to revisit this issue. We show that intermodel differences in sea-ice loss and, more generally, in simulated sea-ice variability, can be traced to differences in the simulation of seasonal growth and melt. The way these processes are simulated is relatively independent of the complexity of the sea-ice model used, but rather a strong function of the background thickness. The larger role played by thermodynamic processes as sea ice thins further suggests that the recent and projected reductions in sea-ice thickness induce a transition of the Arctic towards a state with enhanced volume seasonality but reduced interannual volume variability and persistence, before summer ice-free conditions eventually occur. These results prompt modelling groups to focus their priorities on the reduction of sea-ice thickness biases. Reconciling global-model estimates and country reporting of anthropogenic forest CO2 sinks Achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement requires forest-based mitigation. Collective progress towards this goal will be assessed by the Paris Agreement’s Global stocktake. At present, there is a discrepancy of about 4\\u2009GtCO2\\u2009yr−1 in global anthropogenic net land-use emissions between global models (reflected in IPCC assessment reports) and aggregated national GHG inventories (under the UNFCCC). We show that a substantial part of this discrepancy (about 3.2\\u2009GtCO2\\u2009yr−1) can be explained by conceptual differences in anthropogenic forest sink estimation, related to the representation of environmental change impacts and the areas considered as managed. For a more credible tracking of collective progress under the Global stocktake, these conceptual differences between models and inventories need to be reconciled. We implement a new method of disaggregation of global land model results that allows greater comparability with GHG inventories. This provides a deeper understanding of model–inventory differences, allowing more transparent analysis of forest-based mitigation and facilitating a more accurate Global stocktake. The model–inventory discrepancy in net land-use carbon emissions mainly results from conceptual differences in estimating anthropogenic forest sinks. A revised disaggregation of global land model results allows greater comparability with inventories. Taking climate model evaluation to the next level Earth system models are complex and represent a large number of processes, resulting in a persistent spread across climate projections for a given future scenario. Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers. Earth system models project likely future climates, however, evaluation of their output is challenging. This Perspective discusses new evaluation approaches, considering both simulations and observations, to ensure credible information for decision-making. Towards operational predictions of the near-term climate Near-term climate predictions — which operate on annual to decadal timescales — offer benefits for climate adaptation and resilience, and are thus important for society. Although skilful near-term predictions are now possible, particularly when coupled models are initialized from the current climate state (most importantly from the ocean), several scientific challenges remain, including gaps in understanding and modelling the underlying physical mechanisms. This Perspective discusses how these challenges can be overcome, outlining concrete steps towards the provision of operational near-term climate predictions. Progress in this endeavour will bridge the gap between current seasonal forecasts and century-scale climate change projections, allowing a seamless climate service delivery chain to be established. Drivers of declining CO2 emissions in 18 developed economies Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from fossil fuels and industry increased by 2.2% per year on average between 2005 and 2015 1 . Global emissions need to peak and decline rapidly to limit climate change to well below 2 °C of warming 2,3 , which is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement 4 . Untangling the reasons underlying recent changes in emissions trajectories is critical to guide efforts to attain those goals. Here we analyse the drivers of decreasing CO 2 emissions in a group of 18 developed economies that have decarbonized over the period 2005–2015. We show that within this group, the displacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy and decreases in energy use explain decreasing CO 2 emissions. However, the decrease in energy use can be explained at least in part by a lower growth in gross domestic product. Correlation analysis suggests that policies on renewable energy are supporting emissions reductions and displacing fossil fuels in these 18 countries, but not elsewhere, and that policies on energy efficiency are supporting lower energy use in these 18 countries, as well as more widely. Overall, the evidence shows that efforts to reduce emissions are underway in many countries, but these efforts need to be maintained and enhanced by more stringent policy actions to support a global peak in emissions followed by global emissions reductions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement 3 . Progressing emergent constraints on future climate change In recent years, an evaluation technique for Earth System Models (ESMs) has arisen—emergent constraints (ECs)—which rely on strong statistical relationships between aspects of current climate and future change across an ESM ensemble. Combining the EC relationship with observations could reduce uncertainty surrounding future change. Here, we articulate a framework to assess ECs, and provide indicators whereby a proposed EC may move from a strong statistical relationship to confirmation. The primary indicators are verified mechanisms and out-of-sample testing. Confirmed ECs have the potential to improve ESMs by focusing attention on the variables most relevant to climate projections. Looking forward, there may be undiscovered ECs for extremes and teleconnections, and ECs may help identify climate system tipping points. Emergent constraints can be an evaluation tool for Earth System Models. This Perspective discusses emergent constraints, how they should be assessed, and when these statistical relationships can be confirmed and used to improve understanding of the changing climate system. Decadal global temperature variability increases strongly with climate sensitivity Climate-related risks are dependent not only on the warming trend from GHGs, but also on the variability about the trend. However, assessment of the impacts of climate change tends to focus on the ultimate level of global warming1, only occasionally on the rate of global warming, and rarely on variability about the trend. Here we show that models that are more sensitive to GHGs emissions (that is, higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)) also have higher temperature variability on timescales of several years to several decades2. Counter-intuitively, high-sensitivity climates, as well as having a higher chance of rapid decadal warming, are also more likely to have had historical ‘hiatus’ periods than lower-sensitivity climates. Cooling or hiatus decades over the historical period, which have been relatively uncommon, are more than twice as likely in a high-ECS world (ECS\\u2009=\\u20094.5\\u2009K) compared with a low-ECS world (ECS\\u2009=\\u20091.5\\u2009K). As ECS also affects the background warming rate under future scenarios with unmitigated anthropogenic forcing, the probability of a hyper-warming decade—over ten times the mean rate of global warming for the twentieth century—is even more sensitive to ECS. Projections of temperature often focus on maximum warming levels, with variability less often considered. Investigating decadal variability in models shows those with higher equilibrium climate sensitivity also have a higher chance of super warming, and hiatus periods. Acceleration of global N2O emissions seen from two decades of atmospheric inversion Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important long-lived GHG and an important stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Agricultural practices and the use of N-fertilizers have greatly enhanced emissions of N2O. Here, we present estimates of N2O emissions determined from three global atmospheric inversion frameworks during the period 1998–2016. We find that global N2O emissions increased substantially from 2009 and at a faster rate than estimated by the IPCC emission factor approach. The regions of East Asia and South America made the largest contributions to the global increase. From the inversion-based emissions, we estimate a global emission factor of 2.3\\u2009±\\u20090.6%, which is significantly larger than the IPCC Tier-1 default for combined direct and indirect emissions of 1.375%. The larger emission factor and accelerating emission increase found from the inversions suggest that N2O emission may have a nonlinear response at global and regional scales with high levels of N-input. Estimates of N2O emissions are important given its role as a GHG. Atmospheric inversions indicate emissions increased over the past decade at a rate 2.5 times that estimated using the IPCC default method, and the emissions response to N-input is larger than linear when N-input is high. Carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow amidst slowly emerging climate policies A failure to recognize the factors behind continued emissions growth could limit the world’s ability to shift to a pathway consistent with 1.5 °C or 2 °C of global warming. Continued support for low-carbon technologies needs to be combined with policies directed at phasing out the use of fossil fuels. A topography of climate change research The massive expansion of scientific literature on climate change1 poses challenges for global environmental assessments and our understanding of how these assessments work. Big data and machine learning can help us deal with large collections of scientific text, making the production of assessments more tractable, and giving us better insights about how past assessments have engaged with the literature. We use topic modelling to draw a topic map, or topography, of over 400,000 publications from the Web of Science on climate change. We update current knowledge on the IPCC, showing that compared with the baseline of the literature identified, the social sciences are in fact over-represented in recent assessment reports. Technical, solutions-relevant knowledge—especially in agriculture and engineering—is under-represented. We suggest a variety of other applications of such maps, and our findings have direct implications for addressing growing demands for more solution-oriented climate change assessments that are also more firmly rooted in the social sciences2,3. The perceived lack of social science knowledge in assessment reports does not necessarily imply an IPCC bias, but rather suggests a need for more social science research with a focus on technical topics on climate solutions. The rapid growth of climate change research presents challenges for IPCC assessments and their stated aim of being comprehensive, objective and transparent. Here the authors use topic modelling to map the climate change literature, and assess how well it is represented in IPCC reports. Temporary reduction in daily global CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 forced confinement International audience; Government policies during the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically altered patterns of energy demand around the world. Many international borders were closed and populations were confined to their homes, which reduced transport and changed consumption patterns. Here we compile government policies and activity data to estimate the decrease in CO2 emissions during forced confinements. Daily global CO2 emissions decreased by –17% (–11 to –25% for ±1σ) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport. At their peak, emissions in individual countries decreased by –26% on average. The impact on 2020 annual emissions depends on the duration of the confinement, with a low estimate of –4% (–2 to –7%) if prepandemic conditions return by mid-June, and a high estimate of –7% (–3 to –13%) if some restrictions remain worldwide until the end of 2020. Government actions and economic incentives postcrisis will likely influence the global CO2 emissions path for decades. The appropriate use of reference scenarios in mitigation analysis Comparing emissions scenarios is an essential part of mitigation analysis, as climate targets can be met in various ways with different economic, energy system and co-benefit implications. Typically, a central ‘reference scenario’ acts as a point of comparison, and often this has been a no policy baseline with no explicit mitigative action taken. The use of such baselines is under increasing scrutiny, raising a wider question around the appropriate use of reference scenarios in mitigation analysis. In this Perspective, we assess three critical issues relevant to the use of reference scenarios, demonstrating how different policy contexts merit the use of different scenarios. We provide recommendations to the modelling community on best practice in the creation, use and communication of reference scenarios. Reference scenarios are used to evaluate different mitigation scenarios, allowing understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses. This Perspective considers the appropriate use of reference scenarios in mitigation analysis across different policy contexts. Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19 The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sudden reduction of both GHG emissions and air pollutants. Here, using national mobility data, we estimate global emission reductions for ten species during the period February to June 2020. We estimate that global NOx emissions declined by as much as 30% in April, contributing a short-term cooling since the start of the year. This cooling trend is offset by ~20% reduction in global SO2 emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming. As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01\\u2009±\\u20090.005\\u2009°C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3\\u2009°C by 2050. Global ecological impacts of marine exotic species Exotic species are a growing global ecological threat; however, their overall effects are insufficiently understood. While some exotic species are implicated in many species extinctions, others can provide benefits to the recipient communities. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify and synthesize the ecological effects of 76 exotic marine species (about 6% of the listed exotics) on ten variables in marine communities. These species caused an overall significant, but modest in magnitude (as indicated by a mean effect size of g < 0.2), decrease in ecological variables. Marine primary producers and predators were the most disruptive trophic groups of the exotic species. Approximately 10% (that is, 2 out of 19) of the exotic species assessed in at least three independent studies had significant impacts on native species. Separating the innocuous from the disruptive exotic species provides a basis for triage efforts to control the marine exotic species that have the most impact, thereby helping to meet Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Carbon budgets for 1.5 and 2\\u2009°C targets lowered by natural wetland and permafrost feedbacks Global methane emissions from natural wetlands and carbon release from permafrost thaw have a positive feedback on climate, yet are not represented in most state-of-the-art climate models. Furthermore, a fraction of the thawed permafrost carbon is released as methane, enhancing the combined feedback strength. We present simulations with an inverted intermediate complexity climate model, which follows prescribed global warming pathways to stabilization at 1.5 or 2.0 °C above pre-industrial levels by the year 2100, and which incorporates a state-of-the-art global land surface model with updated descriptions of wetland and permafrost carbon release. We demonstrate that the climate feedbacks from those two processes are substantial. Specifically, permissible anthropogenic fossil fuel CO emission budgets are reduced by 17–23% (47–56 GtC) for stabilization at 1.5 °C, and 9–13% (52–57 GtC) for 2.0 °C stabilization. In our simulations these feedback processes respond more quickly at temperatures below 1.5 °C, and the differences between the 1.5 and 2 °C targets are disproportionately small. This key finding holds for transient emission pathways to 2100 and does not account for longer-term implications of these feedback processes. We conclude that natural feedback processes from wetlands and permafrost must be considered in assessments of transient emission pathways to limit global warming. 2 Consistent multidecadal variability in global temperature reconstructions and simulations over the Common Era Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300–1800\\u2009CE) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20\\u2009years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades. Last phase of the Little Ice Age forced by volcanic eruptions During the first half of the nineteenth century, several large tropical volcanic eruptions occurred within less than three decades. The global climate effects of the 1815 Tambora eruption have been investigated, but those of an eruption in 1808 or 1809 whose source is unknown and the eruptions in the 1820s and 1830s have received less attention. Here we analyse the effect of the sequence of eruptions in observations, global three-dimensional climate field reconstructions and coupled climate model simulations. All the eruptions were followed by substantial drops of summer temperature over the Northern Hemisphere land areas. In addition to the direct radiative effect, which lasts 2–3 years, the simulated ocean–atmosphere heat exchange sustained cooling for several years after these eruptions, which affected the slow components of the climate system. Africa was hit by two decades of drought, global monsoons weakened and the tracks of low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic moved south. The low temperatures and increased precipitation in Europe triggered the last phase of the advance of Alpine glaciers. Only after the 1850s did the transition into the period of anthropogenic warming start. We conclude that the end of the Little Ice Age was marked by the recovery from a sequence of volcanic eruptions, which makes it difficult to define a single pre-industrial baseline. Large volcanic eruptions in the first half of the nineteenth century blurred the transition from the Little Ice Age to anthropogenic warming, and led to sustained cooling, drought in Africa and weakened monsoons, suggests a combination of observations and model simulations. Emergent constraints on Earth’s transient and equilibrium response to doubled CO2 from post-1970s global warming Future global warming is determined by both greenhouse gas emission pathways and Earth’s transient and equilibrium climate response to doubled atmospheric CO2. Energy-balance inference from the instrumental record typically yields central estimates for the transient response of around 1.3\\u2009K and the equilibrium response of 1.5–2.0\\u2009K, which is at the lower end of those from contemporary climate models. Uncertainty arises primarily from poorly known aerosol-induced cooling since the early industrialization era and a temporary cooling induced by evolving sea surface temperature patterns. Here we present an emergent constraint on post-1970s warming, taking advantage of the weakly varying aerosol cooling during this period. We derive a relationship between the transient response and the post-1970s warming in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. We thereby constrain, with the observations, the transient response to 1.67\\u2009K (1.17–2.16\\u2009K, 5–95th percentiles). This is a 20% increase relative to energy-balance inference stemming from previously neglected upper-ocean energy storage. For the equilibrium climate sensitivity we obtain a best estimate of 2.83\\u2009K (1.72–4.12\\u2009K) contingent on the temporary pattern effects exhibited by climate models. If the real world’s surface temperature pattern effects are substantially stronger, then the upper-bound equilibrium sensitivity may be higher than found here. Warming in climate simulations since about 1970, when aerosol cooling showed little variation, constrains the transient climate response to doubled atmospheric CO2 levels to about 1.67\\u2009K, according to an analysis of this emergent constraint. The role of macrophages in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its inflammatory and often progressive subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are becoming the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, and a primary indication for liver transplantation. The pathophysiology of NASH is multifactorial and not yet completely understood; however, innate immunity is a major contributing factor in which liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruited macrophages play a central part in disease progression. In this Review, we assess the evidence for macrophage involvement in the development of steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in NASH. In this process, not only the polarization of liver macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype is important, but adipose tissue macrophages, especially in the visceral compartment, also contribute to disease severity and insulin resistance. Macrophage activation is mediated by factors such as endotoxins and translocated bacteria owing to increased intestinal permeability, factors released from damaged or lipoapoptotic hepatocytes, as well as alterations in gut microbiota and defined nutritional components, including certain free fatty acids, cholesterol and their metabolites. Reflecting the important role of macrophages in NASH, we also review studies investigating drugs that target macrophage recruitment to the liver, macrophage polarization and their inflammatory effects as potential treatment options for patients with NASH. From NASH to HCC: current concepts and future challenges Caloric excess and sedentary lifestyle have led to a global epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The hepatic consequence of metabolic syndrome and obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is estimated to affect up to one-third of the adult population in many developed and developing countries. This spectrum of liver disease ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Owing to the high prevalence of NAFLD, especially in industrialized countries but also worldwide, and the consequent burden of progressive liver disease, there is mounting epidemiological evidence that NAFLD has rapidly become a leading aetiology underlying many cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this Review, we discuss NAFLD-associated HCC, including its epidemiology, the key features of the hepatic NAFLD microenvironment (for instance, adaptive and innate immune responses) that promote hepatocarcinogenesis and the management of HCC in patients with obesity and associated metabolic comorbidities. The challenges and future directions of research will also be discussed, including clinically relevant biomarkers for early detection, treatment stratification and monitoring as well as approaches to therapies for both prevention and treatment in those at risk or presenting with NAFLD-associated HCC. Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension: state of the art Resistant hypertension is defined as a lack of ambulatory blood pressure response to optimized medical treatment after exclusion of secondary hypertension in patients who are fully adherent to antihypertensive therapy. Patients with resistant hypertension are at high risk of complications, particularly cardiovascular events, and optimization of medical treatment remains the cornerstone of their management. Such optimization should be based on simple algorithms and include the use of aldosterone antagonists. The available data from clinical trials do not support the use of device-based approaches such as renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy or arteriovenous anastomosis for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the majority of patients. Therefore, device treatment remains a last-resort for patients with truly resistant hypertension in the context of clinical research in highly skilled tertiary referral centres. Future research should focus on improving understanding of the intrinsic (physiological and psychological factors) and extrinsic (environmental stressors) mechanisms that contribute to a lack of response to blood-pressure-lowering drugs in adherent patients. The use of biomarkers to identify patients with early target organ damage and new technologies, such as renal nerve stimulation, to predict blood pressure responses to renal denervation could aid the selection of patients who might benefit from device therapies. ispartof: NATURE REVIEWS NEPHROLOGY vol:14 issue:7 pages:428-441 ispartof: location:England status: published Estimating and tracking the remaining carbon budget for stringent climate targets Research reported during the past decade has shown that global warming is roughly proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates. Weak average liquid-cloud-water response to anthropogenic aerosols The cooling of the Earth’s climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth’s surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources—such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships—reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate. Emergent constraint on Arctic Ocean acidification in the twenty-first century The ongoing uptake of anthropogenic carbon by the ocean leads to ocean acidification, a process that results in a reduction in pH and in the saturation state of biogenic calcium carbonate minerals aragonite (Ωarag) and calcite (Ωcalc)1,2. Because of its naturally low Ωarag and Ωcalc (refs. 2,3), the Arctic Ocean is considered the region most susceptible to future acidification and associated ecosystem impacts4-7. However, the magnitude of projected twenty-first century acidification differs strongly across Earth system models8. Here we identify an emergent multi-model relationship between the simulated present-day density of Arctic Ocean surface waters, used as a proxy for Arctic deep-water formation, and projections of the anthropogenic carbon inventory and coincident acidification. By applying observations of sea surface density, we constrain the end of twenty-first century Arctic Ocean anthropogenic carbon inventory to 9.0 ± 1.6 petagrams of carbon and the basin-averaged Ωarag and Ωcalc to 0.76 ± 0.06 and 1.19 ± 0.09, respectively, under the high-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate scenario. Our results indicate greater regional anthropogenic carbon storage and ocean acidification than previously projected3,8 and increase the probability that large parts of the mesopelagic Arctic Ocean will be undersaturated with respect to calcite by the end of the century. This increased rate of Arctic Ocean acidification, combined with rapidly changing physical and biogeochemical Arctic conditions9-11, is likely to exacerbate the impact of climate change on vulnerable Arctic marine ecosystems. UTX-mediated enhancer and chromatin remodeling suppresses myeloid leukemogenesis through noncatalytic inverse regulation of ETS and GATA programs The histone H3 Lys27-specific demethylase UTX (or KDM6A) is targeted by loss-of-function mutations in multiple cancers. Here, we demonstrate that UTX suppresses myeloid leukemogenesis through noncatalytic functions, a property shared with its catalytically inactive Y-chromosome paralog, UTY (or KDM6C). In keeping with this, we demonstrate concomitant loss/mutation of KDM6A (UTX) and UTY in multiple human cancers. Mechanistically, global genomic profiling showed only minor changes in H3K27me3 but significant and bidirectional alterations in H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility; a predominant loss of H3K4me1 modifications; alterations in ETS and GATA-factor binding; and altered gene expression after Utx loss. By integrating proteomic and genomic analyses, we link these changes to UTX regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, coordination of the COMPASS complex and enhanced pioneering activity of ETS factors during evolution to AML. Collectively, our findings identify a dual role for UTX in suppressing acute myeloid leukemia via repression of oncogenic ETS and upregulation of tumor-suppressive GATA programs. Gene therapy for retinal dystrophy Counteracting splice defects in the CEP290 gene using RNA antisense oligonucleotides or Cas9-mediated gene editing is a therapeutic strategy for Leber congenital amaurosis type 10—a severe untreatable retinal dystrophy leading to childhood blindness. Precision and accuracy of single-molecule FRET measurements—a multi-laboratory benchmark study Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is increasingly being used to determine distances, structures, and dynamics of biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. However, generalized protocols and FRET standards to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of FRET efficiencies are currently lacking. Here we report the results of a comparative blind study in which 20 labs determined the FRET efficiencies (E) of several dye-labeled DNA duplexes. Using a unified, straightforward method, we obtained FRET efficiencies with s.d. between +/- 0.02 and +/- 0.05. We suggest experimental and computational procedures for converting FRET efficiencies into accurate distances, and discuss potential uncertainties in the experiment and the modeling. Our quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of intensity-based smFRET measurements and a unified correction procedure represents an important step toward the validation of distance networks, with the ultimate aim of achieving reliable structural models of biomolecular systems by smFRET-based hybrid methods.

An online resource for GPCR structure determination and analysis G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce physiological and sensory stimuli into appropriate cellular responses and mediate the actions of one-third of drugs. GPCR structural studies have revealed the general bases of receptor activation, signaling, drug action and allosteric modulation, but so far cover only 13% of nonolfactory receptors. We broadly surveyed the receptor modifications/engineering and methods used to produce all available GPCR crystal and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, and present an interactive resource integrated in GPCRdb ( http://www.gpcrdb.org ) to assist users in designing constructs and browsing appropriate experimental conditions for structure studies. An interactive online resource integrated in the GPCRdb hub presents tools to design GPCR constructs and determine appropriate experimental conditions for structural studies by crystallography and cryo-EM. Mechanistic investigation of mEos4b reveals a strategy to reduce track interruptions in sptPALM Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins repeatedly enter dark states, causing interrupted tracks in single-particle-tracking localization microscopy (sptPALM). We identified a long-lived dark state in photoconverted mEos4b that results from isomerization of the chromophore and efficiently absorbs cyan light. Addition of weak 488-nm light swiftly reverts this dark state to the fluorescent state. This strategy largely eliminates slow blinking and enables the recording of longer tracks in sptPALM with minimum effort. ispartof: NATURE METHODS vol:16 issue:8 pages:707-+ ispartof: location:United States status: published Tailoring cryo-electron microscopy grids by photo-micropatterning for in-cell structural studies Abstract Micromachining by cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling coupled to cryo-electron tomography (ET) enables visualization of macromolecules directly inside cells. Yet, spatial control of cell adhesion on electron microscopy (EM) grids remains a bottleneck in the specimen preparation pipeline. This protocol describes a contactless and mask-free photo-micropatterning of EM grids for site-specific deposition of extracellular matrix-related proteins. We achieved accurate and reproducible cell positioning, leading to optimized preparations for cryo-FIB milling. We tested HeLa and RPE1 cell lines on various grid types (gold or titanium mesh coated with SiO2, gold or carbon films). Briefly, grids were passivated with an anti-fouling agent, followed by controlled ablation of the passivation layer, and further functionalization with fibronectin. The micropatterning procedure takes ~3 h. Employing micropatterning to produce complex shapes generated a predictable intracellular organization, allowing direct correlation between cellular architecture and in-cell 3D-structural characterization of the underlying machinery at molecular resolution. The GPR139 reference agonists 1a and 7c, and tryptophan and phenylalanine share a common binding site GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the brain, in particular in the habenula, hypothalamus and striatum. It has therefore been suggested that GPR139 is a possible target for metabolic disorders and Parkinson’s disease. Several surrogate agonist series have been published for GPR139. Two series published by Shi et al. and Dvorak et al. included agonists 1a and 7c respectively, with potencies in the ten-nanomolar range. Furthermore, Isberg et al. and Liu et al. have previously shown that tryptophan (Trp) and phenylalanine (Phe) can activate GPR139 in the hundred-micromolar range. In this study, we produced a mutagenesis-guided model of the GPR139 binding site to form a foundation for future structure-based ligand optimization. Receptor mutants studied in a Ca2+ assay demonstrated that residues F1093×33, H1875×43, W2416×48 and N2717×38, but not E1083×32, are highly important for the activation of GPR139 as predicted by the receptor model. The initial ligand-receptor complex was optimized through free energy perturbation simulations, generating a refined GPR139 model in agreement with experimental data. In summary, the GPR139 reference surrogate agonists 1a and 7c, and the endogenous amino acids l-Trp and l-Phe share a common binding site, as demonstrated by mutagenesis, ligand docking and free energy calculations. ISSN:2045-2322 Image based Machine Learning for identification of macrophage subsets Abstract Macrophages play a crucial rule in orchestrating immune responses against pathogens and foreign materials. Macrophages have remarkable plasticity in response to environmental cues and are able to acquire a spectrum of activation status, best exemplified by pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes at the two ends of the spectrum. Characterisation of M1 and M2 subsets is usually carried out by quantification of multiple cell surface markers, transcription factors and cytokine profiles. These approaches are time-consuming, require large numbers of cells and are resource intensive. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to develop a simple and fast imaging-based approach that enables automated identification of different macrophage functional phenotypes using their cell size and morphology. Fluorescent microscopy was used to assess cell morphology of different cell types which were stained for nucleus and actin distribution using DAPI and phalloidin respectively. By only analysing their morphology we were able to identify M1 and M2 phenotypes effectively and could distinguish them from naïve macrophages and monocytes with an average accuracy of 90%. Thus we suggest high-content and automated image analysis can be used for fast phenotyping of functionally diverse cell populations with reasonable accuracy and without the need for using multiple markers. MBOAT7 rs641738 variant and hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic individuals Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents an emerging cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in non-cirrhotic individuals. The rs641738 C\\u2009>\\u2009T MBOAT7/TMC4 variant predisposes to progressive NAFLD, but the impact on hepatic carcinogenesis is unknown. In Italian NAFLD patients, the rs641738 T allele was associated with NAFLD-HCC (OR 1.65, 1.08–2.55; n\\u2009=\\u2009765), particularly in those without advanced fibrosis (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The risk T allele was linked to 3’-UTR variation in MBOAT7 and to reduced MBOAT7 expression in patients without severe fibrosis. The number of PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and MBOAT7 risk variants was associated with NAFLD-HCC independently of clinical factors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), but did not significantly improve their predictive accuracy. When combining data from an independent UK NAFLD cohort, in the overall cohort of non-cirrhotic patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009913, 41 with HCC) the T allele remained associated with HCC (OR 2.10, 1.33–3.31). Finally, in a combined cohort of non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C or alcoholic liver disease (n\\u2009=\\u20091121), the T allele was independently associated with HCC risk (OR 1.93, 1.07–3.58). In conclusion, the MBOAT7 rs641738 T allele is associated with reduced MBOAT7 expression and may predispose to HCC in patients without cirrhosis, suggesting it should be evaluated in future prospective studies aimed at stratifying NAFLD-HCC risk. Correcting for photodestruction in super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in the fluorophore emission. A key assumption of the imaging is that the fluorophores are independent, though this is invalidated in the presence of photodestruction. In this work, we evaluate the effect of photodestruction on SOFI imaging using theoretical considerations and computer simulations. We find that photodestruction gives rise to an additional signal that does not present an easily\\xa0interpretable view of the sample structure. This additional signal is strong and the resulting images typically exhibit less noise. Accordingly, these images may be mis-interpreted as being more visually pleasing or more informative. To address this uncertainty, we develop a procedure that can robustly estimate to what extent any particular experiment is affected by photodestruction. We also develop a detailed assessment methodology and use it to evaluate the performance of several correction algorithms. We identify two approaches that can correct for the presence of even strong photodestruction, one of which can be implemented directly in the SOFI calculation software. ispartof: SCIENTIFIC REPORTS vol:7 issue:1 ispartof: location:England status: published Van der Waals MoS2/VO2 heterostructure junction with tunable rectifier behavior and efficient photoresponse Abstract Junctions between n-type semiconductors of different electron affinity show rectification if the junction is abrupt enough. With the advent of 2D materials, we are able to realize thin van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on a large diversity of materials. In parallel, strongly correlated functional oxides have emerged, having the ability to show reversible insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition by collapsing their electronic bandgap under a certain external stimulus. Here, we report for the first time the electronic and optoelectronic characterization of ultra-thin n-n heterojunctions fabricated using deterministic assembly of multilayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) on a phase transition material, vanadium dioxide (VO2). The vdW MoS2/VO2 heterojunction combines the excellent blocking capability of an n-n junction with a high conductivity in on-state, and it can be turned into a Schottky rectifier at high applied voltage or at temperatures higher than 68\\u2009°C, exploiting the metal state of VO2. We report tunable diode-like current rectification with a good diode ideality factor of 1.75 and excellent conductance swing of 120\\u2009mV/dec. Finally, we demonstrate unique tunable photosensitivity and excellent junction photoresponse in the 500/650\\u2009nm wavelength range. A novel quantification-driven proteomic strategy identifies an endogenous peptide of pleiotrophin as a new biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease Abstract We present a new, quantification-driven proteomic approach to identifying biomarkers. In contrast to the identification-driven approach, limited in scope to peptides that are identified by database searching in the first step, all MS data are considered to select biomarker candidates. The endopeptidome of cerebrospinal fluid from 40 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, 40 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 40 controls with subjective cognitive decline was analyzed using multiplex isobaric labeling. Spectral clustering was used to match MS/MS spectra. The top biomarker candidate cluster (215% higher in AD compared to controls, area under ROC curve\\u2009=\\u20090.96) was identified as a fragment of pleiotrophin located near the protein’s C-terminus. Analysis of another cohort (n\\u2009=\\u200960 over four clinical groups) verified that the biomarker was increased in AD patients while no change in controls, Parkinson’s disease or progressive supranuclear palsy was observed. The identification of the novel biomarker pleiotrophin 151–166 demonstrates that our quantification-driven proteomic approach is a promising method for biomarker discovery, which may be universally applicable in clinical proteomics. Host genotype and time dependent antigen presentation of viral peptides: predictions from theory Abstract The rate of progression of HIV infected individuals to AIDS is known to vary with the genotype of the host, and is linked to their allele of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, which present protein degradation products at the cell surface to circulating T-cells. HLA alleles are associated with Gag-specific T-cell responses that are protective against progression of the disease. While Pol is the most conserved HIV sequence, its association with immune control is not as strong. To gain a more thorough quantitative understanding of the factors that contribute to immunodominance, we have constructed a model of the recognition of HIV infection by the MHC class I pathway. Our model predicts surface presentation of HIV peptides over time, demonstrates the importance of viral protein kinetics, and provides evidence of the importance of Gag peptides in the long-term control of HIV infection. Furthermore, short-term dynamics are also predicted, with simulation of virion-derived peptides suggesting that efficient processing of Gag can lead to a 50% probability of presentation within 3 hours post-infection, as observed experimentally. In conjunction with epitope prediction algorithms, this modelling approach could be used to refine experimental targets for potential T-cell vaccines, both for HIV and other viruses. Smoking induces DNA methylation changes in Multiple Sclerosis patients with exposure-response relationship Abstract Cigarette smoking is an established environmental risk factor for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease, although a mechanistic basis remains largely unknown. We aimed at investigating how smoking affects blood DNA methylation in MS patients, by assaying genome-wide DNA methylation and comparing smokers, former smokers and never smokers in two Swedish cohorts, differing for known MS risk factors. Smoking affects DNA methylation genome-wide significantly, an exposure-response relationship exists and the time since smoking cessation affects methylation levels. The results also show that the changes were larger in the cohort bearing the major genetic risk factors for MS (female sex and HLA risk haplotypes). Furthermore, CpG sites mapping to genes with known genetic or functional role in the disease are differentially methylated by smoking. Modeling of the methylation levels for a CpG site in the AHRR gene indicates that MS modifies the effect of smoking on methylation changes, by significantly interacting with the effect of smoking load. Alongside, we report that the gene expression of AHRR increased in MS patients after smoking. Our results suggest that epigenetic modifications may reveal the link between a modifiable risk factor and the pathogenetic mechanisms. Predicting Binding Free Energies of PDE2 Inhibitors. The Difficulties of Protein Conformation Abstract A congeneric series of 21 phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) inhibitors are reported. Crystal structures show how the molecules can occupy a ‘top-pocket’ of the active site. Molecules with small substituents do not enter the pocket, a critical leucine (Leu770) is closed and water molecules are present. Large substituents enter the pocket, opening the Leu770 conformation and displacing the waters. We also report an X-ray structure revealing a new conformation of the PDE2 active site domain. The relative binding affinities of these compounds were studied with free energy perturbation (FEP) methods and it represents an attractive real-world test case. In general, the calculations could predict the energy of small-to-small, or large-to-large molecule perturbations. However, accurately capturing the transition from small-to-large proved challenging. Only when using alternative protein conformations did results improve. The new X-ray structure, along with a modelled dimer, conferred stability to the catalytic domain during the FEP molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, increasing the convergence and thereby improving the prediction of ΔΔG of binding for some small-to-large transitions. In summary, we found the most significant improvement in results when using different protein structures, and this data set is useful for future free energy validation studies. Novel bifunctional cap for simultaneous electroencephalography and transcranial electrical stimulation Abstract Neuromodulation induced by transcranial electric stimulation (TES) exhibited promising potential for clinical practice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain subject of research. The combination of TES and electroencephalography (EEG) offers great potential for investigating these mechanisms and brain function in general, especially when performed simultaneously. In conventional applications, the combination of EEG and TES suffers from limitations on the electrode level (gel for electrode-skin interface) and the usability level (preparation time, reproducibility of positioning). To overcome these limitations, we designed a bifunctional cap for simultaneous TES–EEG applications. We used novel electrode materials, namely textile stimulation electrodes and dry EEG electrodes integrated in a flexible textile cap. We verified the functionality of this cap by analysing the effect of TES on visual evoked potentials (VEPs). In accordance with previous reports using standard TES, the amplitude of the N75 component was significantly decreased post-stimulation, indicating the feasibility of using this novel flexible cap for simultaneous TES and EEG. Further, we found a significant reduction of the P100 component only during TES, indicating a different brain modulation effect during and after TES. In conclusion, the novel bifunctional cap offers a novel tool for simultaneous TES–EEG applications in clinical research, therapy monitoring and closed-loop stimulation. The soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat reduces fibrogenesis and portal pressure in cirrhotic rats Abstract In cirrhotic patients, portal hypertension (PHT) deteriorates survival, yet treatment options are limited. A major contributor to increased intrahepatic vasoconstriction in PHT is dysfunctional nitric-oxide signaling. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the receptor of nitric-oxide and can be stimulated by riociguat. Riociguat is approved for pulmonary hypertension but has not been studied in liver cirrhosis. In this study we assessed the effects of riociguat on PHT and liver fibrosis in cholestatic (bile duct ligation, BDL) and toxic (carbon-tetrachloride, CCl4) rat models. In cirrhotic livers sGC expression was upregulated. In BDL rats, riociguat reduced liver fibrosis and decreased portal pressure without affecting systemic hemodynamics. In an early BDL disease stage, riociguat decreased bile duct proliferation, improved sinusoidal vascular dysfunction and inhibited angiogenesis. In advanced BDL riociguat exhibited anti-inflammatory effects. In CCl4 rats the beneficial effects of riociguat treatment were less pronounced and confined to an early disease stage. Similarly, in patients with cholestatic cirrhosis and PHT nitrates (that induce sGC activity) decreased portal pressure more effectively than in patients with non-cholestatic etiology. We also found an improvement of transaminases in patients with pulmonary hypertension receiving riociguat. Our findings support the clinical development of sGC stimulators in patients with cirrhotic PHT. Phospholipidome of endothelial cells shows a different adaptation response upon oxidative, glycative and lipoxidative stress Endothelial dysfunction has been widely associated with oxidative stress, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity and underlies the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), atherosclerosis and diabetes. In such pathological conditions, lipids are emerging as mediators of signalling pathways evoking key cellular responses as expression of proinflammatory genes, proliferation and apoptosis. Hence, the assessment of lipid profiles in endothelial cells (EC) can provide valuable information on the molecular alterations underlying CVDs, atherosclerosis and diabetes. We performed a lipidomic approach based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) for the analysis of the phospholipidome of bovine aortic EC (BAEC) exposed to oxidative (H2O2), glycative (glucose), or lipoxidative (4-hydroxynonenal, HNE) stress. The phospholipid (PL) profile was evaluated for the classes PC, PE, PS, PG, PI, SM, LPC and CL. H2O2 induced a more acute adaptation of the PL profile than glucose or HNE. Unsaturated PL molecular species were up-regulated after 24h incubation with H2O2, while an opposite trend was observed in glucose- and HNE-treated cells. This study compared, for the first time, the adaptation of the phospholipidome of BAEC upon different induced biochemical stresses. Although further biological studies will be necessary, our results unveil specific lipid signatures in response to characteristic types of stress. Inactive matrix Gla protein is a novel circulating biomarker predicting retinal arteriolar narrowing in humans Active matrix Gla protein (MGP), a potent inhibitor of calcification in large arteries, protects against macrovascular complications. Recent studies suggested that active MGP helps maintaining the integrity of the renal and myocardial microcirculation, but its role in preserving the retinal microcirculation remains unknown. In 935 randomly recruited Flemish participants (mean age, 40.9 years; 50.3% women), we measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker of poor vitamin K status using an ELISA-based assay at baseline (1996-2010) and retinal microvascular diameters using IVAN software (Vasculomatic ala Nicola, version 1.1) including the central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) equivalent and the arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR) at follow-up (2008-2015). CRAE (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005) and AVR (P\\u2009=\\u20090.080) at follow-up decreased across tertiles of the dp-ucMGP distribution. In unadjusted models, for a doubling of dp-ucMGP at baseline, CRAE and AVR at follow-up respectively decreased by 1.40\\u2009µm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 2.48; P\\u2009=\\u20090.011) and 0.006 (CI, 0.001 to 0.011; P\\u2009=\\u20090.016). In multivariable-adjusted models accounting for sex, baseline characteristics and follow-up duration, these estimates were -1.03\\u2009µm (CI, -1.96 to -0.11; P\\u2009=\\u20090.028) and -0.007 (CI, -0.011 to -0.002; P\\u2009=\\u20090.007). Additional adjustment for changes from baseline to follow-up in major baseline characteristics yielded as estimates -0.91\\u2009µm (CI, -1.82 to -0.01; P\\u2009=\\u20090.048) and -0.006 (95% CI, -0.011 to -0.001; P\\u2009=\\u20090.014), respectively. Circulating inactive dp-ucMGP is a long-term predictor of smaller retinal arteriolar diameter in the general population. Our observations highlight the possibility that vitamin K supplementation might promote retinal health. ispartof: SCIENTIFIC REPORTS vol:8 issue:1 ispartof: location:England status: published Differential Effects of a Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonist in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and in Response to Hepatectomy Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with post-operative liver failure (PLF) and impaired liver regeneration. We investigated the effects of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist on NAFLD, PLF and liver regeneration in mice fed chow diet or methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) or high fat diet (HFD). Fc-GLP-1 decreased transaminases, reduced intrahepatic triglycerides (TG) and improved MCD-induced liver dysfuction. Macrophage/Kupffer cell-related markers were also reduced although Fc-GLP-1 increased expression of genes related to natural killer (NK), cytotoxic T lymphocytes and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. After partial hepatectomy (PH), survival rates increased in mice receiving Fc-GLP-1 on chow or MCD diet. However, the benefit of Fc-GLP-1 on NASH-like features was attenuated 2 weeks post-PH and liver mass restoration was not improved. At this time-period, markers of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were further elevated in Fc-GLP-1 treated mice. Increased HSC related gene expression in livers was observed together with decreased retinyl ester content and increased retinal and retinoic acid, reflecting HSC activation. Similar effects were found in mice fed HFD receiving Fc-GLP-1. Our results shed light on the differential effects of a long-acting GLP-1R agonist in improving NAFLD and PLF, but not enhancing liver regeneration in mice. Estimating the risk of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika outbreaks in a large European city Abstract Outbreaks of arbovirus infections vectored by invasive Aedes albopictus have already occurred and are predicted to become increasingly frequent in Southern Europe. We present a probabilistic model to assess risk of arbovirus outbreaks based on incident cases worldwide, on the probability of arrival of infected travelers, and on the abundance of the vector species. Our results show a significant risk of Chikungunya outbreak in Rome from mid June to October in simulations with high human biting rates (i.e. when ≥50% of the population is bitten every day). The outbreak risk is predicted to be highest for Chikungunya and null for Zika. Simulated increase of incident cases in selected endemic countries has no major impact on the outbreak risk. The model correctly estimated the number of imported cases and can be easily adapted to other urban areas where Ae. albopictus is the only potential vector present. Zika virus infection perturbs osteoblast function Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is typically characterized by a mild self-limiting disease presenting with fever, rash, myalgia and arthralgia and severe fetal complications during pregnancy such as microcephaly, subcortical calcifications and arthrogyropsis. Virus-induced arthralgia due to perturbed osteoblast function has been described for other arboviruses. In case of ZIKV infection, the role of osteoblasts in ZIKV pathogenesis and bone related pathology remains unknown. Here, we study the effect of ZIKV infection on osteoblast differentiation, maturation and function by quantifying activity and gene expression of key biomarkers, using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs, osteoblast precursors). MSCs were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts and we found that osteoblasts were highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. While infection did not cause a cytopathic effect, a significant reduction of key osteogenic markers such as ALP, RUNX2, calcium contents and increased expression of IL6 in ZIKV-infected MSCs implicated a delay in osteoblast development and maturation, as compared to uninfected controls. In conclusion, we have developed and characterized a new in vitro model to study the role of bone development in ZIKV pathogenesis, which will help to identify possible new targets for developing therapeutic and preventive measures. ElectroMap: High-throughput open-source software for analysis and mapping of cardiac electrophysiology Abstract The ability to record and analyse electrical behaviour across the heart using optical and electrode mapping has revolutionised cardiac research. However, wider uptake of these technologies is constrained by the lack of multi-functional and robustly characterised analysis and mapping software. We present ElectroMap, an adaptable, high-throughput, open-source software for processing, analysis and mapping of complex electrophysiology datasets from diverse experimental models and acquisition modalities. Key innovation is development of standalone module for quantification of conduction velocity, employing multiple methodologies, currently not widely available to researchers. ElectroMap has also been designed to support multiple methodologies for accurate calculation of activation, repolarisation, arrhythmia detection, calcium handling and beat-to-beat heterogeneity. ElectroMap implements automated signal segmentation, ensemble averaging and integrates optogenetic approaches. Here we employ ElectroMap for analysis, mapping and detection of pro-arrhythmic phenomena in silico, in cellulo, animal model and in vivo patient datasets. We anticipate that ElectroMap will accelerate innovative cardiac research and enhance the uptake, application and interpretation of mapping technologies leading to novel approaches for arrhythmia prevention. Voluntary exercise in mice fed an obesogenic diet alters the hepatic immune phenotype and improves metabolic parameters – an animal model of life style intervention in NAFLD Abstract Reproducible animal models to recapitulate the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are urgently required to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of liver injury and to explore novel therapeutic options. Current guidelines recommend life-style interventions as first-line therapy for NAFLD and these types of intervention are considered standard-of-care. The current study establishes a reproducible mouse model of a\\xa0life-style intervention in NAFLD using voluntary wheel running (VWR). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD or a corresponding control diet for 12 weeks. Starting at week 9 of the obesogenic NAFLD diet, mice were randomized to either free access to a running wheel or being single caged resembling a sedentary (SED) life-style. VWR induced a transient weight reduction in HFD-fed mice up until week 10. In contrast to the SED mice, VWR mice exhibited normal ALT at the end of the intervention, while the metabolic alterations including elevated fasting glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels remained almost unchanged. Additionally, VWR prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by alterations in key liver metabolic processes including the induction of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis inhibition following increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α activity. Phosphorylation of the serine kinase Akt in hepatic tissue was enhanced following VWR. Furthermore, VWR mice were protected from HFD-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and liver macrophage infiltration. The SED/HFD group exhibited increasing activity of hepatic nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65, which was absent following exercise in the VWR/HFD group. In summary, in an obesogenic mouse model of NAFLD physical exercise improves fatty acid and glucose homeostasis and protects from macrophage-associated hepatic inflammation. Rho-kinase inhibitor coupled to peptide-modified albumin carrier reduces portal pressure and increases renal perfusion in cirrhotic rats Rho-kinase (ROCK) activation in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) is a key mechanism promoting liver fibrosis and portal hypertension (PTH). Specific delivery of ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 (Y27) to HSC targeting mannose-6-phosphate-receptors reduces portal pressure and fibrogenesis. In decompensated cirrhosis, presence of ascites is associated with reduced renal perfusion. Since in cirrhosis, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) is upregulated in the liver as well as the kidney, this study coupled Y27 to human serum albumin (HSA) substituted with PDGFRβ-recognizing peptides (pPB), and investigated its effect on PTH in cirrhotic rats. In vitro collagen contraction assays tested biological activity on LX2 cells. Hemodynamics were analyzed in BDL and CCl 4 cirrhotic rats 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after i.v. administration of Y27pPBHSA (0.5/1 mg/kg b.w). Phosphorylation of moesin and myosin light chain (MLC) assessed ROCK activity in liver, femoral muscle, mesenteric artery, kidney and heart. Three Y27 molecules were coupled to pPBHSA as confirmed by HPLC/MS, which was sufficient to relax LX2 cells. In vivo, Y27pPBHSA-treated rats exhibited lower portal pressure, hepatic vascular resistance without effect on systemic vascular resistance, but a tendency towards lower cardiac output compared to non-treated cirrhotic rats. Y27pPBHSA reduced intrahepatic resistance by reduction of phosphorylation of moesin and MLC in Y27pPBHSA-treated cirrhotic rats. Y27pPBHSA was found in the liver of rats up to 6 hours after its injection, in the HSC demonstrated by double-immunostainings. Interestingly, Y27pPBHSA increased renal arterial flow over time combined with an antifibrotic effect as shown by decreased renal acta2 and col1a1 mRNA expression. Therefore, targeting the ROCK inhibitor Y27 to PDGFRβ decreases portal pressure with potential beneficial effects in the kidney. This unique approach should be tested in human cirrhosis. Climate controls on snow reliability in French Alps ski resorts Ski tourism is a major sector of mountain regions economy, which is under the threat of long-term climate change. Snow management, and in particular grooming and artificial snowmaking, has become a routine component of ski resort operations, holding potential for counteracting the detrimental effect of natural snow decline. However, conventional snowmaking can only operate under specific meteorological conditions. Whether snowmaking is a relevant adaptation measure under future climate change is a widely debated issue in mountainous regions, with major implications on the supply side of this tourism industry. This often lacks comprehensive scientific studies for informing public and private decisions in this sector. Here we show how climate change influences the operating conditions of one of the main ski tourism markets worldwide, the French Alps. Our study addresses snow reliability in 129 ski resorts in the French Alps in the 21st century, using a dedicated snowpack model explicitly accounting for grooming and snowmaking driven by a large ensemble of adjusted and downscaled regional climate projections, and using a geospatial model of ski resorts organization. A 45% snowmaking fractional coverage, representative of the infrastructures in the early 2020s, is projected to improve snow reliability over grooming-only snow conditions, both during the reference period 1986–2005 and below 2\\u2009°C global warming since pre-industrial. Beyond 3\\u2009°C of global warming, with 45% snowmaking coverage, snow conditions would become frequently unreliable and induce higher water requirements. TGR(mREN2)27 rats develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated portal hypertension responsive to modulations of Janus-kinase 2 and Mas receptor Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing. Resulting fibrosis and portal hypertension, as a possible secondary event, may necessitate treatment. Overexpression of mouse renin in the transgenic rat model, TGR(mREN2)27, leads to spontaneous development of NAFLD. Therefore, we used TGR(mREN2)27 rats as a model of NAFLD where we hypothesized increased susceptibility and investigated fibrosis and portal hypertension and associated pathways. 12-week old TGR(mREN2)27 rats received either cholestatic (BDL) or toxic injury (CCl4 inhalation). Portal and systemic hemodynamic assessments were performed using microsphere technique with and without injection of the Janus-Kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor AG490 or the non-peptidic Ang(1-7) agonist, AVE0991. The extent of liver fibrosis was assessed in TGR(mREN2)27 and wild-type rats using standard techniques. Protein and mRNA levels of profibrotic, renin-angiotensin system components were assessed in liver and primary hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and hepatocytes. TGR(mREN2)27 rats developed spontaneous, but mild fibrosis and portal hypertension due to the activation of the JAK2/Arhgef1/ROCK pathway. AG490 decreased migration of HSC and portal pressure in isolated liver perfusions and in vivo. Fibrosis or portal hypertension after cholestatic (BDL) or toxic injury (CCl4) was not aggravated in TGR(mREN2)27 rats, probably due to decreased mouse renin expression in hepatocytes. Interestingly, portal hypertension was even blunted in TGR(mREN2)27 rats (with or without additional injury) by AVE0991. TGR(mREN2)27 rats are a suitable model of spontaneous liver fibrosis and portal hypertension but not with increased susceptibility to liver damage. After additional injury, the animals can be used to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies targeting Mas. Dietary wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors promote features of murine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease AbstractWe previously demonstrated that a common dietary protein component, wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI), stimulate intestinal macrophages and dendritic cells via toll like receptor 4. Activation of these intestinal myeloid cells elicits an inflammatory signal that is propagated to mesenteric lymph nodes, and that can facilitate extraintestinal inflammation. Mice were fed a well-defined high fat diet, with (HFD/ATI) or without (HFD) nutritionally irrelevant amounts of ATI. Mice on HFD/ATI developed only mild signs of intestinal inflammation and myeloid cell activation but displayed significantly higher serum triglycerides and transaminases compared to mice on HFD alone. Moreover, they showed increased visceral and liver fat, and a higher insulin resistance. ATI feeding promoted liver and adipose tissue inflammation, with M1-type macrophage polarization and infiltration, and enhanced liver fibrogenesis. Gluten, the major protein component of wheat, did not induce these pathologies. Therefore, wheat ATI ingestion in minute quantities comparable to human daily wheat consumption exacerbated features of the metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, despite its irrelevant caloric value. Using mechanistic models for the clinical interpretation of complex genomic variation Abstract The sustained generation of genomic data in the last decade has increased the knowledge on the causal mutations of a large number of diseases, especially for highly penetrant Mendelian diseases, typically caused by a unique or a few genes. However, the discovery of causal genes in complex diseases has been far less successful. Many complex diseases are actually a consequence of the failure of complex biological modules, composed by interrelated proteins, which can happen in many different ways, which conferring a multigenic nature to the condition that can hardly be attributed to one or a few genes. We present a mechanistic model, Hipathia, implemented in a web server that allows estimating the effect that mutations, or changes in the expression of genes, have over the whole system of human signaling and the corresponding functional consequences. We show several use cases where we demonstrate how different the ultimate impact of mutations with similar loss-of-function potential can be and how the potential pathological role of a damaged gene can be inferred within the context of a signaling network. The use of systems biology-based approaches, such as mechanistic models, allows estimating the potential impact of loss-of-function mutations occurring in proteins that are part of complex biological interaction networks, such as signaling pathways. This holistic approach provides an elegant alternative to gene-centric approaches that can open new avenues in the interpretation of the genomic variability in complex diseases. Unraveling the choice of the north Atlantic subpolar gyre index International audience; The north Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) has been widely implicated as the source of large-scale changes in the subpolar marine environment. However, inconsistencies between indices of SPG-strength have raised questions about the active role SPG-strength and size play in determining water properties in the eastern subpolar North Atlantic (ENA). Here, by analyzing various SPG indices derived from observations and a global coupled model, we show that the choice of the SPG index dictates the interpretation of SPG strength-salinity relationship in the ENA. Variability in geostrophic currents derived from observed hydrography and model based Lagrangian trajectories reveal zonal shifts of advective pathways in the enA and meridional shifts in the western intergyre region. Such shifts in advective pathways are manifestations of variability in the size and strength of the SPG, and they impact salinity by modulating the proportion of subpolar and subtropical waters reaching the enA. SpG indices based on subsurface density and principal component analysis of sea surface height variability capture these shifts in advective pathways, and are therefore best suited to describe SPG-salinity relationship in the enA. our results establish the dynamical constraints on the choice of the SpG index and emphasize that SPG indices should be cautiously interpreted. Beyond Forcing Scenarios: Predicting Climate Change through Response Operators in a Coupled General Circulation Model AbstractGlobal Climate Models are key tools for predicting the future response of the climate system to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here we show how to use statistical mechanics to construct operators able to flexibly predict climate change. We perform our study using a fully coupled model - MPI-ESM v.1.2 - and for the first time we prove the effectiveness of response theory in predicting future climate response to CO2 increase on a vast range of temporal scales, from inter-annual to centennial, and for very diverse climatic\\xa0variables. We investigate within a unified perspective the transient climate response and the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and assess the role of fast and slow processes. The prediction of the ocean heat uptake highlights the very slow relaxation to a newly established steady state. The change in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is accurately predicted. The AMOC strength is initially reduced and then undergoes a slow and partial recovery. The ACC strength initially increases due to changes in the wind stress, then undergoes a slowdown, followed by a recovery leading to a overshoot with respect to the initial value. Finally, we are able to predict accurately the temperature change in the North Atlantic. Robust skill of decadal climate predictions There is a growing need for skilful predictions of climate up to a decade ahead. Decadal climate predictions show high skill for surface temperature, but confidence in forecasts of precipitation and atmospheric circulation is much lower. Recent advances in seasonal and annual prediction show that the signal-to-noise ratio can be too small in climate models, requiring a very large ensemble to extract the predictable signal. Here, we reassess decadal prediction skill using a much larger ensemble than previously available, and reveal significant skill for precipitation over land and atmospheric circulation, in addition to surface temperature. We further propose a more powerful approach than used previously to evaluate the benefit of initialisation with observations, improving our understanding of the sources of skill. Our results show that decadal climate is more predictable than previously thought and will aid society to prepare for, and adapt to, ongoing climate variability and change. Redox tuning the Weakley-type polyoxometalate archetype for the oxygen evolution reaction Water oxidation is a key reaction for the conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels, but effective water-oxidation catalysts are often based on rare and costly precious metals such as Pt, Ir or Ru. Developing strategies based on earth-abundant metals is important to explore critical aspects of this reaction, and to see whether different and more efficient applications are possible for energy systems. Herein, we present an approach to tuning a redox-active electrocatalyst based on the doping of molybdenum into the tungsten framework of [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10−, known as the Weakley sandwich. The Mo-doped framework was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry studies. The doping of molybdenum into the robust Weakley sandwich framework leads to the oxidation of water at a low onset potential, and with no catalyst degradation, whereby the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction is lowered by 188 mV compared with the pure tungsten framework. Selective Negative Allosteric Modulation Of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors – A Structural Perspective of Ligands and Mutants The metabotropic glutamate receptors have a wide range of modulatory functions in the central nervous system. They are among the most highly pursued drug targets, with relevance for several neurological diseases, and a number of allosteric modulators have entered clinical trials. However, so far this has not led to a marketed drug, largely because of the difficulties in achieving subtype-selective compounds with desired properties. Very recently the first crystal structures were published for the transmembrane domain of two metabotropic glutamate receptors in complex with negative allosteric modulators. In this analysis, we make the first comprehensive structural comparison of all metabotropic glutamate receptors, placing selective negative allosteric modulators and critical mutants into the detailed context of the receptor binding sites. A better understanding of how the different mGlu allosteric modulator binding modes relates to selective pharmacological actions will be very valuable for rational design of safer drugs. Phosphorylated IGFBP-1 as a non-invasive predictor of liver fat in NAFLD Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) is a potentially interesting marker for liver fat in NAFLD as it is exclusively produced by the liver, and insulin is its main regulator. We determined whether measurement of fasting serum phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (fS-pIGFBP-1) helps to predict liver fat compared to routinely available clinical parameters and PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409. Liver fat content (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) was measured in 378 subjects (62% women, age 43 [30-54] years, BMI 32.7 [28.1-39.7] kg/m(2), 46% with NAFLD). Subjects were randomized to discovery and validation groups, which were matched for clinical and biochemical parameters and PNPLA3 genotype. Multiple linear regression and Random Forest modeling were used to identify predictors of liver fat. The final model, % Liver Fat Equation\\', included age, fS-pIGFBP-1, S-ALT, waist-to-hip ratio, fP-Glucose and fS-Insulin (adjusted R-2 = 0.44 in the discovery group, 0.49 in the validation group, 0.47 in all subjects). The model was significantly better than a model without fS-pIGFBP-1 or S-ALT or S-AST alone. Random Forest modeling identified fS-p-IGFBP-1 as one of the top five predictors of liver fat (adjusted R-2 = 0.39). Therefore, measurement of fS-pIGFBP-1 may help in non-invasive prediction of liver fat content. Peer reviewed The role of fluid pressure in induced vs. triggered seismicity: insights from rock deformation experiments on carbonates Fluid overpressure is one of the primary mechanisms for tectonic fault slip, because fluids lubricate the fault and fluid pressure reduces the effective normal stress that holds the fault in place. However, current models of earthquake nucleation, based on rate- and state- friction laws, imply that stable sliding is favoured by the increase of pore fluid pressure. Despite this controversy, currently, there are only a few studies on the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions. Here, we use laboratory experiments, to show that the rate- and state- friction parameters do change with increasing fluid pressure. We tested carbonate gouges from sub hydrostatic to near lithostatic fluid pressure conditions, and show that the friction rate parameter (a\\u2009−\\u2009b) evolves from velocity strengthening to velocity neutral behaviour. Furthermore, the critical slip distance, Dc, decreases from about 90 to 10\\u2009μm. Our data suggest that fluid overpressure plays an important role in controlling the mode of fault slip. Since fault rheology and fault stability parameters change with fluid pressure, we suggest that a comprehensive characterization of these parameters is fundamental for better assessing the role of fluid pressure in natural and human induced earthquakes. Putative histidine kinase inhibitors with antibacterial effect against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates identified by in vitro and in silico screens Novel antibacterials are urgently needed to address the growing problem of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics. Two-component systems (TCS) are widely used by bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to various environmental stimuli and physiological stress and have been previously proposed as promising antibacterial targets. TCS consist of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and an effector response regulator. The HK component contains a highly conserved ATP-binding site that is considered to be a promising target for broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs. Here, we describe the identification of putative HK autophosphorylation inhibitors following two independent experimental approaches: in vitro fragment-based screen via differential scanning fluorimetry and in silico structure-based screening, each followed up by the exploration of analogue compounds as identified by ligand-based similarity searches. Nine of the tested compounds showed antibacterial effect against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens and include three novel scaffolds, which have not been explored so far in other antibacterial compounds. Overall, putative HK autophosphorylation inhibitors were found that together provide a promising starting point for further optimization as antibacterials. CTCF contributes in a critical way to spermatogenesis and male fertility The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an architectural protein that governs chromatin organization and gene expression in somatic cells. Here, we show that CTCF regulates chromatin compaction necessary for packaging of the paternal genome into mature sperm. Inactivation of Ctcf in male germ cells in mice (Ctcf-cKO mice) resulted in impaired spermiogenesis and infertility. Residual spermatozoa in Ctcf-cKO mice displayed abnormal head morphology, aberrant chromatin compaction, impaired protamine 1 incorporation into chromatin and accelerated histone depletion. Thus, CTCF regulates chromatin organization during spermiogenesis, contributing to the functional organization of mature sperm. Amyloid precursor protein expression and processing are differentially regulated during cortical neuron differentiation Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product amyloid β (Aβ) have been thoroughly studied in Alzheimer\\'s disease. However, APP also appears to be important for neuronal development. Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) towards cortical neurons enables in vitro mechanistic studies on human neuronal development. Here, we investigated expression and proteolytic processing of APP during differentiation of human iPSCs towards cortical neurons over a 100-day period. APP expression remained stable during neuronal differentiation, whereas APP processing changed. α-Cleaved soluble APP (sAPPα) was secreted early during differentiation, from neuronal progenitors, while β-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPβ) was first secreted after deep-layer neurons had formed. Short Aβ peptides, including Aβ1-15/16, peaked during the progenitor stage, while processing shifted towards longer peptides, such as Aβ1-40/42, when post-mitotic neurons appeared. This indicates that APP processing is regulated throughout differentiation of cortical neurons and that amyloidogenic APP processing, as reflected by Aβ1-40/42, is associated with mature neuronal phenotypes. Förster resonance energy transfer and protein-induced fluorescence enhancement as synergetic multi-scale molecular rulers Advanced microscopy methods allow obtaining information on (dynamic) conformational changes in biomolecules via measuring a single molecular distance in the structure. It is, however, extremely challenging to capture the full depth of a three-dimensional biochemical state, binding-related structural changes or conformational cross-Talk in multi-protein complexes using one-dimensional assays. In this paper we address this fundamental problem by extending the standard molecular ruler based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a two-dimensional assay via its combination with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE). We show that donor brightness (via PIFE) and energy transfer efficiency (via FRET) can simultaneously report on e.g., the conformational state of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) following its interaction with unlabelled proteins (BamHI, EcoRV, and T7 DNA polymerase gp5/trx). The PIFE-FRET assay uses established labelling protocols and single molecule fluorescence detection schemes (alternating-laser excitation, ALEX). Besides quantitative studies of PIFE and FRET ruler characteristics, we outline possible applications of ALEX-based PIFE-FRET for single-molecule studies with diffusing and immobilized molecules. Finally, we study transcription initiation and scrunching of E. coli RNA-polymerase with PIFE-FRET and provide direct evidence for the physical presence and vicinity of the polymerase that causes structural changes and scrunching of the transcriptional DNA bubble. Novel Agonist Bioisosteres and Common Structure-Activity Relationships for The Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139 GPR139 is an orphan class A G protein-coupled receptor found mainly in the central nervous system. It has its highest expression levels in the hypothalamus and striatum, regions regulating metabolism and locomotion, respectively, and has therefore been suggested as a potential target for obesity and Parkinson\\'s disease. The two aromatic amino acids L-Trp and L-Phe have been proposed as putative endogenous agonists, and three structurally related benzohydrazide, glycine benzamide, and benzotriazine surrogate agonist series have been published. Herein, we assayed 158 new analogues selected from a pharmacophore model, and identified 12 new GPR139 agonists, containing previously untested bioisosteres. Furthermore, we present the first combined structure-activity relationships, and a refined pharmacophore model to serve as a rationale for future ligand identification and optimization. Serum neurofilament light protein predicts clinical outcome in traumatic brain injury Axonal white matter injury is believed to be a major determinant of adverse outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that measurement of neurofilament light protein (NF-L), a protein found in long white-matter axons, in blood samples, may serve as a suitable biomarker for neuronal damage in TBI patients. To test our hypotheses, we designed a study in two parts: i) we developed an immunoassay based on Single molecule array technology for quantification of NF-L in blood, and ii) in a proof-of-concept study, we tested our newly developed method on serial serum samples from severe TBI (sTBI) patients (n\\u2009=\\u200972) and controls (n\\u2009=\\u200935). We also compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of NF-L with the established blood biomarker S100B. NF-L levels were markedly increased in sTBI patients compared with controls. NF-L at admission yielded an AUC of 0.99 to detect TBI versus controls (AUC 0.96 for S100B), and increased to 1.00 at day 12 (0.65 for S100B). Importantly, initial NF-L levels predicted poor 12-month clinical outcome. In contrast, S100B was not related to outcome. Taken together, our data suggests that measurement of serum NF-L may be useful to assess the severity of neuronal injury following sTBI. Statistical power considerations in genotype-based recall randomized controlled trials Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are often underpowered for validating gene-treatment interactions. Using published data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), we examined power in conventional and genotype-based recall (GBR) trials. We calculated sample size and statistical power for gene-metformin interactions (vs. placebo) using incidence rates, gene-drug interaction effect estimates and allele frequencies reported in the DPP for the rs8065082 SLC47A1 variant, a metformin transported encoding locus. We then calculated statistical power for interactions between genetic risk scores (GRS), metformin treatment and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) given a range of sampling frames, clinical trial sample sizes, interaction effect estimates, and allele frequencies; outcomes were type 2 diabetes incidence (time-to-event) and change in small LDL particles (continuous outcome). Thereafter, we compared two recruitment frameworks: GBR (participants recruited from the extremes of a GRS distribution) and conventional sampling (participants recruited without explicit emphasis on genetic characteristics). We further examined the influence of outcome measurement error on statistical power. Under most simulated scenarios, GBR trials have substantially higher power to observe gene-drug and gene-lifestyle interactions than same-sized conventional RCTs. GBR trials are becoming popular for validation of gene-treatment interactions; our analyses illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this design. Effect of probe diffusion on the SOFI imaging accuracy Live-cell super-resolution fluorescence imaging is becoming commonplace for exploring biological systems, though sample dynamics can affect the imaging quality. In this work we evaluate the effect of probe diffusion on super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI), using a theoretical model and numerical simulations based on the imaging of live cells labelled with photochromic fluorescent proteins. We find that, over a range of physiological conditions, fluorophore diffusion results in a change in the amplitude of the SOFI signal. The magnitude of this change is approximately proportional to the on-time ratio of the fluorophores. However, for photochromic fluorescent proteins this effect is unlikely to present a significant distortion in practical experiments in biological systems. Due to this lack of distortions, probe diffusion strongly enhances the SOFI imaging by avoiding spatial undersampling caused by the limited labeling density. ispartof: Scientific Reports vol:7 pages:44665- ispartof: location:England status: published The modulation of adult neuroplasticity is involved in the mood-improving actions of atypical antipsychotics in an animal model of depression Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with an increasing impact in global public health. However, a large proportion of patients treated with currently available antidepressant drugs fail to achieve remission. Recently, antipsychotic drugs have received approval for the treatment of antidepressant-resistant forms of major depression. The modulation of adult neuroplasticity, namely hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal remodeling, has been considered to have a key role in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. However, the impact of antipsychotic drugs on these neuroplastic mechanisms remains largely unexplored. In this study, an unpredictable chronic mild stress protocol was used to induce a depressive-like phenotype in rats. In the last 3 weeks of stress exposure, animals were treated with two different antipsychotics: haloperidol (a classical antipsychotic) and clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic). We demonstrated that clozapine improved both measures of depressive-like behavior (behavior despair and anhedonia), whereas haloperidol aggravated learned helplessness in the forced-swimming test and behavior flexibility in a cognitive task. Importantly, an upregulation of adult neurogenesis and neuronal survival was observed in animals treated with clozapine, whereas haloperidol promoted a downregulation of these processes. Furthermore, clozapine was able to re-establish the stress-induced impairments in neuronal structure and gene expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate the modulation of adult neuroplasticity by antipsychotics in an animal model of depression, revealing that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine reverts the behavioral effects of chronic stress by improving adult neurogenesis, cell survival and neuronal reorganization. Towards dial-a-molecule by integrating continuous flow, analytics and self-optimisation The employment of continuous-flow platforms for synthetic chemistry is becoming increasingly popular in research and industrial environments. Integrating analytics in-line enables obtaining a large amount of information in real-time about the reaction progress, catalytic activity and stability, etc. Furthermore, it is possible to influence the reaction progress and selectivity via manual or automated feedback optimisation, thus constituting a dial-a-molecule approach employing digital synthesis. This contribution gives an overview of the most significant contributions in the field to date. Au nanoparticle scaffolds modulating intermolecular interactions among the conjugated azobenzenes chemisorbed on curved surfaces: tuning the kinetics of cis–trans isomerisation π–π Intermolecular interactions among the adjacent conjugated azobenzenes chemisorbed on (non-)flat Au surfaces can be tuned by varying the curvature of the Au nanoparticles. Influence of the supramolecular order on the electrical properties of 1D coordination polymers based materials Inter-chain interactions play a fundamental role in the conductive properties of metal coordination polymers based on terpyridine–pyridine ligands. Identification of the first surrogate agonists for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR132 We report the first pharmacological tool agonist for in vitro characterization of the orphan receptor GPR132, preliminary structure–activity relationships based on 32 analogs and a suggested binding mode from docking. Modulating the charge injection in organic field-effect transistors: fluorinated oligophenyl self-assembled monolayers for high work function electrodes Experiment and theory reveals origin of work function and contact resistance of fluorinated oligophenylthiol-treated electrodes in organic transistors. Optically switchable transistors comprising a hybrid photochromic molecule/n-type organic active layer Photoswitchable transistors based on a blend of an n-type fullerene derivative and a photochromic diarylethene can be gated either through the gate electrode or by photoisomerization of the diarylethene molecules. Exploiting the equilibrium dynamics in the self-assembly of inorganic macrocycles based upon polyoxothiometalate building blocks We report the preparation and characterization of two new polyoxothiometalate species, {Mo16} = {(Mo2O2S2)8(OH)16(C4O4)2}(4-) (compound 1) and {Mo12} = {(Mo2O2S2)6(OH)12(CH3COO)2}(2-) (compound 2). Control of synthesis is achieved by the addition of the organic-template and further re-arrangement is controlled simply by the addition of potassium to a precursor compound yielding compound 2. The structures of the compounds are discussed and we also show that ion-mobility mass spectrometry can be used to resolve the species and their building blocks in solution. TTF–PTM dyads: from switched molecular self assembly in solution to radical conductors in solid state Dyads formed by tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) linked to perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radicals exhibit interesting physical properties such as bistability in solution or conductivity in solid state. Exploring the solvent mediated assembly and redox activity of a POM–organic hybrid [Na(SO3)2(PhPO3)4MoV4MoVI14O49]5− We report the electrochemical activity and the mechanism of formation of a mixed valence polyoxometalate-based organic hybrid cluster with the formula [Na(SO3)2(PhPO3)4MoV4MoVI14O49]5- (1). Electrochemical investigations of the mixed valence compound 1 showed three redox couples, in which the electrons were mainly delocalized over eight Mo sites. Furthermore, the synthesis was investigated using 31P-NMR, which showed that the self-assembly of cluster 1 was triggered by the addition of organic solvents, and was largely independent of the nature of the solvents, suggesting that a decrease in the concentration of water promoted cluster assembly. Finally the stability of 1 was explored and we concluded that the use of phenylphosphonate allowed the covalent stabilization of the [MoV4MoVI14] core. A four-state capacitance molecular switch based on a redox active tetrathiafulvalene self-assembled monolayer An electroactive tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on gold has been prepared and fully characterised by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Transfer rates of the same order were found for the two redox processes. Remarkably, the TTF SAM was successfully exploited as a 4-state electrochemical switch using the capacitance of the SAM as output signal. Design, synthesis, chemical stability, packing, cyclic voltammetry, ionisation potential, and charge transport of [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene derivatives Five new molecular semiconductors that differ from dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene, by the introduction of ether or thioether side chains, have been synthesized and obtained in good yields. Their availability in sufficient quantities has allowed investigation of their electrochemical behaviour in solution and their electronic properties in solid state. Both ether and thioether compounds oxidise rather easily in solution, but nevertheless, they exhibit rather high ionisation potentials. This is a consequence of their crystal structure. Dioctylthioetherbenzothienobenzothiophene is rather sensitive to oxidation and degrades easily in close to ambient conditions. Dioctyletherbenzothienobenzothiophene is more stable. Its charge carrier mobility remains however rather moderate, on the order of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas that of dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene reached 4 cm2 V−1 s−1, in the same conditions. The difference is explained by intrinsic factors as shown by a theoretical modelling. Live-cell monochromatic dual-label sub-diffraction microscopy by mt-pcSOFI We present mt-pcSOFI, live-cell monochromatic sub-diffraction imaging and illustrate the method with existing RSFPs and the newly developed ffDronpa-F. Selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using an electrogenerated polyoxometalate redox mediator The 2-electron reduced form of the polyoxometalate silicotungstic acid (H4[SiW12O4]) is shown to be an effective and selective hydrogenation agent for a range of nitroarenes without the need for any co-catalyst. The ease of generation of the active species and its recyclability suggest that a new approach to this important class of chemical conversions is possible. Iminium and enamine catalysis in enantioselective photochemical reactions Herein we report an effective synthetic method for the direct assembly of highly functionalized tetracyclic pharmacophoric cores. Coumarins and chromones undergo diastereoselective [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with light-generated photoenol intermediates. The reactions occur by aid of a microfluidic photoreactor (MFP) in high yield (up to >98%) and virtually complete diastereocontrol (>20:1 dr). The method is easily scaled-up to a parallel setup, furnishing 948 mg of product over a 14 h reaction time. Finally, a series of manipulations of the tetracyclic scaffold obtained gave access to valuable precursors of biologically active molecules. A practical, organic-mediated, hybrid electrolyser that decouples hydrogen production at high current densities Hydrogen is seen as a sustainable fuel of the future, yet the vast majority of global hydrogen production comes from the reformation of fossil fuels. Electrolytic water splitting using proton exchange membrane electrolysers (PEMEs) provides a pathway to sustainable hydrogen production through coupling to renewable energy sources, but can suffer from gas crossover at low current densities and high operating pressures, causing explosive gas mixtures and decreasing cell lifetimes. Here we demonstrate the application of a highly stable, organic electron-coupled proton buffer (ECPB) which allows the decoupling of hydrogen and oxygen production during water splitting. By merging concepts from redox flow battery and PEM electrolysis research, we have built a hybrid electrolyser device capable of decoupling the gas evolution reactions during water splitting. The device improves on both gas purity and operational safety, while still working at industrially relevant, high current density. Anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid was used as an organic redox mediator in this two-step process, producing H2 at current densities of up to 3.71 A cm-2 at 2.00 V, extending the concept of the ECPB. Nanoparticles induce dermal and intestinal innate immune system responses in zebrafish embryos Metal and plastic nanoparticles elicit innate immune responses in the skin and intestine of zebrafish embryos potentially serving as key event for AOPs. A robust, modular approach to produce graphene–MOx multilayer foams as electrodes for Li-ion batteries Major breakthroughs in batteries would require the development of new composite electrode materials, with a precisely controlled nanoscale architecture. However, composites used for energy storage are typically a disordered bulk mixture of different materials, or simple coatings of one material onto another. We demonstrate here a new technique to create complex hierarchical electrodes made of multilayers of vertically aligned nanowalls of hematite (Fe2O3) alternated with horizontal spacers of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), all deposited on a 3D, conductive graphene foam. The RGO nanosheets act as porous spacers, current collectors and protection against delamination of the hematite. The multilayer composite, formed by up to 7 different layers, can be used with no further processing as an anode in Li-ion batteries, with a specific capacity of up to 1175 μA h cm−2 and a capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles. Our coating strategy gives improved cyclability and rate capacity compared to conventional bulk materials. Our production method is ideally suited to assemble an arbitrary number of organic–inorganic materials in an arbitrary number of layers. Biomimetic graphene for enhanced interaction with the external membrane of astrocytes Graphene and graphene substrates display huge potential as material interfaces for devices and biomedical tools targeting the modulation or recovery of brain functionality. However, to be considered reliable neural interfaces, graphene-derived substrates should properly interact with astrocytes, favoring their growth and avoiding adverse gliotic reactions. Indeed, astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the human brain and they have a crucial physiological role to maintain its homeostasis and modulate synaptic transmission. In this work, we describe a new strategy based on the chemical modification of graphene oxide (GO) with a synthetic phospholipid (PL) to improve interaction of GO with brain astroglial cells. The PL moieties were grafted on GO sheets through polymeric brushes obtained by atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP) between acryloyl-modified PL and GO nanosheets modified with a bromide initiator. The adhesion of primary rat cortical astrocytes on GO–PL substrates increased by about three times with respect to that on glass substrates coated with standard adhesion agents (i.e., poly-D-lysine, PDL) as well as with respect to that on non-functionalized GO. Moreover, we show that astrocytes seeded on GO–PL did not display significant gliotic reactivity, indicating that the material interface did not cause a detrimental inflammatory reaction when interacting with astroglial cells. Our results indicate that the reported biomimetic approach could be applied to neural prosthesis to improve cell colonization and avoid glial scar formation in brain implants. Additionally, improved adhesion could be extremely relevant in devices targeting neural cell sensing/modulation of physiological activity. DeltaDelta neural networks for lead optimization of small molecule potency The capability to rank different potential drug molecules against a protein target for potency has always been a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry due to its importance in drug design. While several simulation-based methodologies exist, they are hard to use prospectively and thus predicting potency in lead optimization campaigns remains an open challenge. Here we present the first machine learning approach specifically tailored for ranking congeneric series based on deep 3D-convolutional neural networks. Furthermore we prove its effectiveness by blindly testing it on datasets provided by Janssen, Pfizer and Biogen totalling over 3246 ligands and 13 targets as well as several well-known openly available sets, representing one the largest evaluations ever performed. We also performed online learning simulations of lead optimization using the approach in a predictive manner obtaining significant advantage over experimental choice. We believe that the evaluation performed in this study is strong evidence of the usefulness of a modern deep learning model in lead optimization pipelines against more expensive simulation-based alternatives. Giant molecular filaments in the Milky Way Filamentary structures are common morphological features of the cold, molecular interstellar medium (ISM). Recent studies have discovered massive, hundred-parsec-scale filaments that may be connected to the large-scale, Galactic spiral arm structure. Addressing the nature of these Giant Molecular Filaments (GMFs) requires a census of their occurrence and properties. We perform a systematic search of GMFs in the fourth Galactic quadrant and determine their basic physical properties. We identify GMFs based on their dust extinction signatures in near- and mid-infrared and velocity structure probed by ^{13}CO line emission. We use the ^{13}CO line emission and ATLASGAL dust emission data to estimate the total and dense gas masses of the GMFs. We combine our sample with an earlier sample from literature and study the Galactic environment of the GMFs. We identify nine GMFs in the fourth Galactic quadrant; six are located in the Centaurus spiral arm and three in inter-arm regions. Combining this sample with an earlier study using the same identification criteria in the first Galactic quadrant results in 16 GMFs, nine of which are located within spiral arms. The GMFs have sizes of 80-160 pc and ^{13}CO-derived masses between 5-90 x 10^{4} Msun. Their dense gas mass fractions are between 1.5-37%, being higher in the GMFs connected to spiral arms. We also compare the different GMF-identification methods and find that emission and extinction based techniques overlap only partially, highlighting the need to use both to achieve a complete census. Resolving the fragmentation of high line-mass filaments with ALMA: the integral shaped filament in Orion A We study the fragmentation of the nearest high line-mass filament, the integral shaped filament (ISF, line-mass _$\\\\sim_$ 400 M_$_\\\\odot_$ pc_$^{-1}_$) in the Orion A molecular cloud. We have observed a 1.6 pc long section of the ISF with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 3 mm continuum emission, at a resolution of _$\\\\sim_$3\" (1 200 AU). We identify from the region 43 dense cores with masses about a solar mass. 60% of the ALMA cores are protostellar and 40\\\\% are starless. The nearest neighbour separations of the cores do not show a preferred fragmentation scale; the frequency of short separations increases down to 1 200 AU. We apply a two-point correlation analysis on the dense core separations and show that the ALMA cores are significantly grouped at separations below _$\\\\sim_$17 0 AU and strongly grouped below _$\\\\sim_$6 0 AU. The protostellar and starless cores are grouped differently: only the starless cores group strongly below _$\\\\sim_$6 0 AU. In addition, the spatial distribution of the cores indicates periodic grouping of the cores into groups of _$\\\\sim_$30 0 AU in size, separated by _$\\\\sim_$50 0 AU. The groups coincide with dust column density peaks detected by Herschel. These results show hierarchical, two-mode fragmentation in which the maternal filament periodically fragments into groups of dense cores. Critically, our results indicate that the fragmentation models for lower line-mass filaments (_$\\\\sim_$ 16 M_$_\\\\odot_$ pc_$^{-1}_$) fail to capture the observed properties of the ISF. We also find that the protostars identified with Spitzer and Herschel in the ISF are grouped at separations below _$\\\\sim_$17 0 AU. In contrast, young stars with disks do not show significant grouping. This suggests that the grouping of dense cores is partially retained over the protostar lifetime, but not over the lifetime of stars with disks. What are we learning from the relative orientation between density structures and the magnetic field in molecular clouds? We investigate the conditions of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence responsible for the relative orientation between density structures, characterized by their gradient, _$\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}\\\\rho_$, and the magnetic field, _$\\\\vec{B}_$, in molecular clouds (MCs). For that purpose, we construct an expression for the time evolution of the angle, _$\\\\phi_$, between _$\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}\\\\rho_$ and _$\\\\vec{B}_$ based on the transport equations of MHD turbulence. Using this expression, we find that the configuration where _$\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}\\\\rho_$ and _$\\\\vec{B}_$ are mostly parallel, _$\\\\cos\\\\phi=1_$, and where _$\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}\\\\rho_$ and _$\\\\vec{B}_$ are mostly perpendicular, _$\\\\cos\\\\phi=0_$, constitute attractors, that is, the system tends to evolve towards either of these configurations and they are more represented than others. This fact would explain the predominant alignment or anti-alignment between column density, _$N_H_$, structures and the projected magnetic field orientation, _$\\\\hat{B}_\\\\perp_$, reported in observations. Additionally, we find that departures from the _$\\\\cos\\\\phi=0_$ configurations are related to convergent flows, quantified by the divergence of the velocity field, _$\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{v}_$, in the presence of a relatively strong magnetic field. This would explain the observed change in relative orientation between _$N_H_$-structures and _$\\\\hat{B}_\\\\perp_$ towards MCs, from mostly parallel at low _$N_H_$ to mostly perpendicular at the highest _$N_H_$, as the result of the gravitational collapse and/or convergence of flows. Finally, we show that the density threshold that marks the observed change in relative orientation towards MCs, from _$N_H_$ and _$\\\\hat{B}_\\\\perp_$ being mostly parallel at low _$N_H_$ to mostly perpendicular at the highest _$N_H_$, is related to the magnetic field strength and constitutes a crucial piece of information for determining the role of the magnetic field in the dynamics of MCs. Fragmentation and disk formation during high-mass star formation Context. High-mass stars form in clusters, but neither the early fragmentation processes nor the detailed physical processes leading to the most massive stars are well understood. Aims. We aim to understand the fragmentation, as well as the disk formation, outflow generation, and chemical processes during high-mass star formation on spatial scales of individual cores. Methods. Using the IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in combination with the 30 m telescope, we have observed in the IRAM large program CORE the 1.37 mm continuum and spectral line emission at high angular resolution (~0.4″) for a sample of 20 well-known high-mass star-forming regions with distances below 5.5 kpc and luminosities larger than 104 L⊙. Results. We present the overall survey scope, the selected sample, the observational setup, and the main goals of CORE. Scientifically, we concentrated on the mm continuum emission on scales on the order of 1000 AU. We detect strong mm continuum emission from all regions, mostly due to the emission from cold dust. The fragmentation properties of the sample are diverse. We see extremes where some regions are dominated by a single high-mass core whereas others fragment into as many as 20 cores. A minimum-spanning-tree analysis finds fragmentation at scales on the order of the thermal Jeans length or smaller suggesting that turbulent fragmentation is less important than thermal gravitational fragmentation. The diversity of highly fragmented vs. singular regions can be explained by varying initial density structures and/or different initial magnetic field strengths. Conclusions. A large sample of high-mass star-forming regions at high spatial resolution allows us to study the fragmentation properties of young cluster-forming regions. The smallest observed separations between cores are found around the angular resolution limit which indicates that further fragmentation likely takes place on even smaller spatial scales. The CORE project with its numerous spectral line detections will address a diverse set of important physical and chemical questions in the field of high-mass star formation. Substructures in the Keplerian disc around the O-type (proto-)star G17.64+0.16 We present the highest angular resolution (∼20\\u2005×\\u200515 mas–44\\u2005×\\u200533 au) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations that are currently possible of the proto-O-star G17.64+0.16 in Band 6. The Cycle 5 observations with baselines out to 16 km probe scales < 50 au and reveal the rotating disc around G17.64+0.16, a massive forming O-type star. The disc has a ring-like enhancement in the dust emission that is especially visible as arc structures to the north and south. The Keplerian kinematics are most prominently seen in the vibrationally excited water line, H2O 55,\\u20060−64,\\u20063\\u2006ν2\\u2004=\\u20041 (Eu\\u2004=\\u20043461.9 K). The mass of the central source found by modelling the Keplerian rotation is consistent with 45\\u2005±\\u200510\\u2006M⊙. The H30α (231.9 GHz) radio-recombination line and the SiO (5-4) molecular line were detected at up to the ∼10σ level. The estimated disc mass is 0.6\\u2005−\\u20052.6\\u2006M⊙ under the optically thin assumption. Analysis of the Toomre Q parameter in the optically thin regime indicates that the disc stability is highly dependent on temperature. The disc currently appears stable for temperatures > 150 K; this does not preclude that the substructures formed earlier through disc fragmentation. Using Herschel and Planck observations to delineate the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud structure We present a study of the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onto the plane of sky (B⊥) on scales down to 0.4 pc, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of Galactic dust observed by Planck at 353 GHz, and the distribution of gas column density (NH) structures on scales down to 0.026 pc, derived from the observations by Herschel in submillimeter wavelengths, toward ten nearby (d < 450 pc) molecular clouds. Using the histogram of relative orientation technique in combination with tools from circular statistics, we found that the mean relative orientation between NH and B⊥ toward these regions increases progressively from 0°, where the NH structures lie mostly parallel to B⊥, with increasing NH, in many cases reaching 90°, where the NH structures lie mostly perpendicular to B⊥. We also compared the relative orientation between NH and B⊥ and the distribution of NH, which is characterized by the slope of the tail of the NH probability density functions (PDFs). We found that the slopes of the NH PDF tail are steepest in regions where NH and B⊥ are close to perpendicular. This coupling between the NH distribution and the magnetic field suggests that the magnetic fields play a significant role in structuring the interstellar medium in and around molecular clouds. However, we found no evident correlation between the star formation rates, estimated from the counts of young stellar objects, and the relative orientation between NH and B⊥ in these regions. Genetic Factors That Affect Risk of Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies have informed our understanding of factors contributing to the well-recognized interindividual variation in the progression and outcomes of alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We discuss the mounting evidence for shared modifiers and common pathophysiological processes that contribute to development of both diseases. We discuss the functions of proteins encoded by risk variants of genes including patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2, as well as epigenetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We also discuss important areas of future genetic research and their potential to affect clinical management of patients. Accuracy of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test vs FibroTest, Elastography, and Indirect Markers in Detection of Advanced Fibrosis in Patients With Alcoholic Liver Disease Background & aims Alcohol is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality, but we lack serum markers to detect compensated disease. We compared the accuracy of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test (ELF), the FibroTest, liver stiffness measurements (made by transient elastography and 2-dimensional shear-wave elastography), and 6 indirect marker tests in detection of advanced liver fibrosis (Kleiner stage ≥F3). Methods We performed a prospective study of 10 liver fibrosis markers (patented and not), all performed on the same day. Patients were recruited from primary centers (municipal alcohol rehabilitation, n\\xa0= 128; 6% with advanced fibrosis) and secondary health care centers (hospital outpatient clinics, n\\xa0= 161; 36% with advanced fibrosis) in the Region of Southern Denmark from 2013 through 2016. Biopsy-verified fibrosis stage was used as the reference standard. The primary aim was to validate ELF in detection of advanced fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease recruited from primary and secondary health care centers, using the literature-based cutoff value of 10.5. Secondary aims were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ELF for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis and to determine whether combinations of fibrosis markers increase diagnostic yield. Results The ELF identified patients with advanced liver fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89–0.96); findings did not differ significantly between patients from primary vs secondary care ( P \\xa0= .917). ELF more accurately identified patients with advanced liver fibrosis than indirect marker tests, but ELF and FibroTest had comparable diagnostic accuracies (AUROC of FibroTest, 0.90) ( P \\xa0= .209 for comparison with ELF). Results from the ELF and FibroTest did not differ significantly from those of liver stiffness measurement in intention-to-diagnose analyses (AUROC for transient elastography, 0.90), but did differ in the per-protocol analysis (AUROC for transient elastography, 0.97) ( P \\xa0= .521 and .004 for comparison with ELF). Adding a serum marker to transient elastography analysis did not increase accuracy. For patients in primary care, ELF values below 10.5 and FibroTest values below 0.58 had negative predictive values for advanced liver fibrosis of 98% and 94%, respectively. Conclusion In a prospective, direct comparison of tests, ELF and FibroTest identified advanced liver fibrosis in alcoholic patients from primary and secondary care with high diagnostic accuracy (AUROC values of 0.90 or higher using biopsy as reference). Advanced fibrosis can be ruled out in primary health care patients based on an ELF value below 10.5 or a FibroTest value below 0.58. Fatty Acid and Glucose Sensors in Hepatic Lipid Metabolism: Implications in NAFLD The term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a pathologic spectrum from lipid accumulation alone (simple steatosis) to steatosis with associated inflammation and fibrosis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis and potentially to hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a genetic predisposition has been highlighted, NAFLD is strongly associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and hypercaloric diet in the context of obesity and metabolic disease. The dysregulation of specific pathways (insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, fatty acid, and lipoprotein metabolism) have been linked to steatosis, but elucidating the molecular events determining evolution of the disease still requires further research before it can be translated into specific personalized interventional strategies. In this review, the authors focus on the early events of the pathophysiology of NASH, dissecting the metabolic and nutritional pathways involving fatty acids and glucose sensors that can modulate lipid accumulation in the liver, but also condition the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Genetics of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Spotlight on PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum that spans simple steatosis, through nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by substantial interpatient variation in rate of progression and disease outcome: Although up to 25% of the general population are at risk of progressive disease, only a minority experience associated liver-related morbidity. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a complex disease trait that occurs when environmental exposures act upon a susceptible polygenic background composed of multiple independent modifiers. Recent advances include the identification of PNPLA3 as a modifier of disease outcome across the full spectrum of NAFLD from steatosis to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; and the discovery of TM6SF2 as a potential \"master regulator\" of metabolic syndrome outcome, determining not only risk of advanced liver disease, but also cardiovascular disease outcomes. In this article, the authors will review the field, discussing in detail the current status of research into these important genetic modifiers of NAFLD progression. Genetics of Alcoholic Liver Disease Excess alcohol consumption with consequent alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of liver dysfunction and liver-related mortality worldwide. However, although the majority of heavy drinkers will develop steatosis, only a minority progress to advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. Thus, ALD is a complex disease where subtle interpatient genetic variations and environmental factors interact to determine disease progression. One genome-wide association study specifically addressing genetic modifiers of ALD has been published. However, most of our understanding is based on studies conducted on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Translation of candidates from these studies into ALD has established a role for variants in genes including PNPLA3 and potentially TM6SF2 across the disease spectrum from steatosis, through cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here the authors review the current status of the field with a particular focus on recent advances. Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition of β-Nitrostyrenes to Olefins upon Irradiation with Visible Light The title compounds were found to undergo a [2+2] photocycloaddition with olefins at λ = 419 nm in CH2Cl2 as the solvent. The resulting cyclobutanes were isolated in yields of 32–87% (11 examples) and showed a defined relative configuration at C1/C4 in the major dia\\xadstereoisomer (nitro and aryl trans). The analysis of side products and triplet sensitization experiments support a mechanistic scenario in which a 1,4-diradical is formed as a key intermediate. Synthesis of Chiral Thiourea-Thioxanthone Hybrids Four different 1-aminocyclohexanes bearing a tethered thioxanthone group in the 2-position were prepared. The synthesis commenced with the respective N-protected β-amino acids, the carboxyl group of which was employed for the introduction of the thioxanthone moiety. After construction of the thioxanthone and protecting group removal, the conversion of the amino group into the respective thiourea was accomplished by treatment with N-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isothiocyanate and yielded the title compounds in which the thioxanthone resides in different spatial positions relative to the thiourea motif. Overall yields varied between 20–35%. Pregnancy Outcomes after ZIKV Infection in French Territories in the Americas BACKGROUND: The risk of congenital neurologic defects related to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has ranged from 6 to 42% in various reports. The aim of this study was to estimate this risk among pregnant women with symptomatic ZIKV infection in French territories in the Americas. METHODS: From March 2016 through November 2016, we enrolled in this prospective cohort study pregnant women with symptomatic ZIKV infection that was confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. The analysis included all data collected up to April 27, 2017, the date of the last delivery in the cohort. RESULTS: Among the 555 fetuses and infants in the 546 pregnancies included in the analysis, 28 (5.0%) were not carried to term or were stillborn, and 527 were born alive. Neurologic and ocular defects possibly associated with ZIKV infection were seen in 39 fetuses and infants (7.0%; 95% confidence interval, 5.0 to 9.5); of these, 10 were not carried to term because of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons, 1 was stillborn, and 28 were live-born. Microcephaly (defined as head circumference more than 2 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age) was detected in 32 fetuses and infants (5.8%), of whom 9 (1.6%) had severe microcephaly (more than 3 SD below the mean). Neurologic and ocular defects were more common when ZIKV infection occurred during the first trimester (24 of 189 fetuses and infants [12.7%]) than when it occurred during the second trimester (9 of 252 [3.6%]) or third trimester (6 of 114 [5.3%]) (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant women with symptomatic, PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection, birth defects possibly associated with ZIKV infection were present in 7% of fetuses and infants. Defects occurred more frequently in fetuses and infants whose mothers had been infected early in pregnancy. Longer-term follow-up of infants is required to assess any manifestations not detected at birth. (Funded by the French Ministry of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02916732 .). An ultra-sensitive and wideband magnetometer based on a superconducting           quantum interference device The magnetic field noise in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) used for biomagnetic research such as magnetoencephalography or ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance is usually limited by instrumental dewar noise. We constructed a wideband, ultra-low noise system with a 45 mm diameter superconducting pick-up coil inductively coupled to a current sensor SQUID. Thermal noise in the liquid helium dewar is minimized by using aluminized polyester fabric as superinsulation and aluminum oxide strips as heat shields, respectively. With a magnetometer pick-up coil in the center of the Berlin magneti- cally shielded room 2 (BMSR2) a noise level of around 150 aT Hz_$^{-1/2}_$ is achieved in the white noise regime between about 20 kHz and the system bandwidth of about 2.5 MHz. At lower frequencies, the resolution is limited by magnetic field noise arising from the walls of the shielded room. Modeling the BMSR2 as a closed cube with continuous \\\\mu-metal walls we can quantitatively reproduce its measured field noise. Study of a water-graphene capacitor with molecular density functional theory Most of the performances of electrochemical devices are governed by molecular processes taking place at the solution-electrode interfaces and molecular simulation are the main way to study these processes. Aqueous electrochemical systems have often been studied using classical DFT but with too crude approximations to consider the system description to be realistic. We study the interface between graphene electrodes and liquid water at different applied voltage using molecular DFT, improving the state of the art by the following key points: 1) electrodes have a realistic atomic resolution, 2) classical DFT calculations are carried out at fixed imposed potential difference and 3) water is described by a molecular model. This allows to reveal the structural modification of water adsorbed at the graphene interface and the evolution of water dielectric permittivity when a voltage is applied. The computed capacitance of this device is in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. This demonstrates the relevance of molecular DFT to study electrochemical systems at the molecular level. Event synchrony measures for functional climate network analysis: A case study on South American rainfall dynamics Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of climate extremes has gained considerable relevance in the context of ongoing climate change. With enhanced computational capacity, data driven methods such as functional climate networks have been proposed and have already contributed to significant advances in understanding and predicting extreme events, as well as identifying interrelations between the occurrences of various climatic phenomena. While the (in its basic setting) parameter free event synchronization (ES) method has been widely applied to construct functional climate networks from extreme event series, its original definition has been realized to exhibit problems in handling events occurring at subsequent time steps, which need to be accounted for. Along with the study of this conceptual limitation of the original ES approach, event coincidence analysis (ECA) has been suggested as an alternative approach that incorporates an additional parameter for selecting certain time scales of event synchrony. In this work, we compare selected features of functional climate network representations of South American heavy precipitation events obtained using ES and ECA without and with the correction for temporal event clustering. We find that both measures exhibit different types of biases, which have profound impacts on the resulting network structures. By combining the complementary information captured by ES and ECA, we revisit the spatiotemporal organization of extreme events during the South American Monsoon season. While the corrected version of ES captures multiple time scales of heavy rainfall cascades at once, ECA allows disentangling those scales and thereby tracing the spatiotemporal propagation more explicitly. Zika plasma viral dynamics in nonhuman primates provides insights into early infection and antiviral strategies The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with fetal abnormalities and neurological complications, prompting global concern. Here we present a mathematical analysis of the within-host dynamics of plasma ZIKV burden in a nonhuman primate model, allowing for characterization of the growth and clearance of ZIKV within individual macaques. We estimate that the eclipse phase for ZIKV, the time between cell infection and viral production, is most likely short (∼4 h), the median within-host basic reproductive number R0 is 10.7, the rate of viral production is rapid (>25,000 virions d−1), and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. We assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load (VL) can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak median VL by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median VL by ∼2 d, whereas treatment given 2 d postinfection is mostly ineffective in accelerating plasma VL loss in macaques. Artificial intelligence exploration of unstable protocells leads to predictable properties and discovery of collective behavior Protocell models are used to investigate how cells might have first assembled on Earth. Some, like oil-in-water droplets, can be seemingly simple models, while able to exhibit complex and unpredictable behaviors. How such simple oil-in-water systems can come together to yield complex and life-like behaviors remains a key question. Herein, we illustrate how the combination of automated experimentation and image processing, physicochemical analysis, and machine learning allows significant advances to be made in understanding the driving forces behind oil-in-water droplet behaviors. Utilizing >7,000 experiments collected using an autonomous robotic platform, we illustrate how smart automation cannot only help with exploration, optimization, and discovery of new behaviors, but can also be core to developing fundamental understanding of such systems. Using this process, we were able to relate droplet formulation to behavior via predicted physical properties, and to identify and predict more occurrences of a rare collective droplet behavior, droplet swarming. Proton NMR spectroscopic and qualitative pH methods enabled us to better understand oil dissolution, chemical change, phase transitions, and droplet and aqueous phase flows, illustrating the utility of the combination of smart-automation and traditional analytical chemistry techniques. We further extended our study for the simultaneous exploration of both the oil and aqueous phases using a robotic platform. Overall, this work shows that the combination of chemistry, robotics, and artificial intelligence enables discovery, prediction, and mechanistic understanding in ways that no one approach could achieve alone. Environmental control programs the emergence of distinct functional ensembles from unconstrained chemical reactions Many approaches to the origin of life focus on how the molecules found in biology might be made in the absence of biological processes, from the simplest plausible starting materials. Another approach could be to view the emergence of the chemistry of biology as process whereby the environment effectively directs “primordial soups” toward structure, function, and genetic systems over time. This does not require the molecules found in biology today to be made initially, and leads to the hypothesis that environment can direct chemical soups toward order, and eventually living systems. Herein, we show how unconstrained condensation reactions can be steered by changes in the reaction environment, such as order of reactant addition, and addition of salts or minerals. Using omics techniques to survey the resulting chemical ensembles we demonstrate there are distinct, significant, and reproducible differences between the product mixtures. Furthermore, we observe that these differences in composition have consequences, manifested in clearly different structural and functional properties. We demonstrate that simple variations in environmental parameters lead to differentiation of distinct chemical ensembles from both amino acid mixtures and a primordial soup model. We show that the synthetic complexity emerging from such unconstrained reactions is not as intractable as often suggested, when viewed through a chemically agnostic lens. An open approach to complexity can generate compositional, structural, and functional diversity from fixed sets of simple starting materials, suggesting that differentiation of chemical ensembles can occur in the wider environment without the need for biological machinery. Molecular mimicry between Anoctamin 2 and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 associates with multiple sclerosis risk Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, likely autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, among which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a strong suspect. We have previously identified increased autoantibody levels toward the chloride-channel protein Anoctamin 2 (ANO2) in MS. Here, IgG antibody reactivity toward ANO2 and EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was measured using bead-based multiplex serology in plasma samples from 8,746 MS cases and 7,228 controls. We detected increased anti-ANO2 antibody levels in MS (P = 3.5 × 10−36) with 14.6% of cases and 7.8% of controls being ANO2 seropositive (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]: 1.5 to 1.8). The MS risk increase in ANO2-seropositive individuals was dramatic when also exposed to 3 known risk factors for MS: HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriage, absence of HLA-A*02:01, and high anti-EBNA1 antibody levels (OR = 24.9; 95%CI: 17.9 to 34.8). Reciprocal blocking experiments with ANO2 and EBNA1 peptides demonstrated antibody cross-reactivity, mapping to ANO2 [aa 140 to 149] and EBNA1 [aa 431 to 440]. HLA gene region was associated with anti-ANO2 antibody levels and HLA-DRB1*04:01 haplotype was negatively associated with ANO2 seropositivity (OR = 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.7). Anti-ANO2 antibody levels were not increased in patients from 3 other inflammatory disease cohorts. The HLA influence and the fact that specific IgG production usually needs T cell help provides indirect evidence for a T cell ANO2 autoreactivity in MS. We propose a hypothesis where immune reactivity toward EBNA1 through molecular mimicry with ANO2 contributes to the etiopathogenesis of MS. Inflammation-related plasma and CSF biomarkers for multiple sclerosis Effective biomarkers for multiple sclerosis diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and treatment responses, in particular those measurable in blood, are largely lacking. We have investigated a broad set of protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma using a highly sensitive proteomic immunoassay. Cases from two independent cohorts were compared with healthy controls and patients with other neurological diseases. We identified and replicated 10 cerebrospinal fluid proteins including IL-12B, CD5, MIP-1a, and CXCL9 which had a combined diagnostic efficacy similar to immunoglobulin G (IgG) index and neurofilament light chain (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.95). Two plasma proteins, OSM and HGF, were also associated with multiple sclerosis in comparison to healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity of combined CSF and plasma markers for multiple sclerosis were 85.7% and 73.5%, respectively. In the discovery cohort, eotaxin-1 (CCL11) was associated with disease duration particularly in patients who had secondary progressive disease (PCSF< 4 × 10−5,Pplasma< 4 × 10−5), and plasma CCL20 was associated with disease severity (P= 4 × 10−5), although both require further validation. Treatment with natalizumab and fingolimod showed different compartmental changes in protein levels of CSF and peripheral blood, respectively, including many disease-associated markers (e.g., IL12B, CD5) showing potential application for both diagnosing disease and monitoring treatment efficacy. We report a number of multiple sclerosis biomarkers in CSF and plasma for early disease detection and potential indicators for disease activity. Of particular importance is the set of markers discovered in blood, where validated biomarkers are lacking. Unraveling the complexity of amyloid polymorphism using gold nanoparticles and cryo-EM Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid polymorphism gives rise to different strains of amyloids with distinct toxicities and pathology-spreading properties. Validating this hypothesis is challenging due to a lack of tools and methods that allow for the direct characterization of amyloid polymorphism in hydrated and complex biological samples. Here, we report on the development of 11-mercapto-1-undecanesulfonate-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) that efficiently label the edges of synthetic, recombinant, and native amyloid fibrils derived from different amyloidogenic proteins. We demonstrate that these NPs represent powerful tools for assessing amyloid morphological polymorphism, using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The NPs allowed for the visualization of morphological features that are not directly observed using standard imaging techniques, including transmission electron microscopy with use of the negative stain or cryo-EM imaging. The use of these NPs to label native paired helical filaments (PHFs) from the postmortem brain of a patient with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as amyloid fibrils extracted from the heart tissue of a patient suffering from systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, revealed a high degree of homogeneity across the fibrils derived from human tissue in comparison with fibrils aggregated in vitro. These findings are consistent with, and strongly support, the emerging view that the physiologic milieu is a key determinant of amyloid fibril strains. Together, these advances should not only facilitate the profiling and characterization of amyloids for structural studies by cryo-EM, but also pave the way to elucidate the structural basis of amyloid strains and toxicity, and possibly the correlation between the pathological and clinical heterogeneity of amyloid diseases. How the performance of hydrological models relates to credibility of projections under climate change Understanding the impact of climate change on runoff is essential for effective water resource management and planning. In this study, the regional climate model (RCM) RegCM4.5 was used to dynamically downscale near-future climate projections from two global climate models to a 50-km horizontal resolution over the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (UYRB). Based on the bias-corrected climate projection results, the impacts of climate change on mid-twenty-first century precipitation and temperature in the UYRB were assessed. Then, through the coupling of a large-scale hydrological model with RegCM4.5, the impacts of climate change on river flows at the outlets of the UYRB were assessed. According to the projections, the eastern UYRB will tend to be warm-dry in the near-future relative to the reference period, whereas the western UYRB will tend to be warm-humid. Precipitation will decreases at a rate of 19.05–19.25 mm/10 a, and the multiyear average annual precipitation will vary between − 0.5 and 0.5 mm/day. Temperature is projected to increases significantly at a rate of 0.38–0.52 °C/10 a, and the projected multiyear average air temperature increase is approximately 1.3–1.5 ℃. The contribution of snowmelt runoff to the annual runoff in the UYBR is only approximately 4%, whereas that to the spring runoff is approximately 9.2%. Affected by climate warming, the annual average snowmelt runoff in the basin will be reduced by 36–39%, whereas the total annual runoff will be reduced by 4.1–5%, and the extreme runoff will be slightly reduced. Areas of projected decreased runoff depth are mainly concentrated in the southeast region of the basin. The decrease in precipitation is driving this decrease in the southeast, whereas the decreased runoff depth in the northwest is mainly driven by the increase in evaporation. Durability of single-dose rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine responses: what do we know? The live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) has proven immunogenic in humans and effective in field studies. Yet long-term durability of vaccine responses is unknown. Exploring the biochemistry of the prenylome and its role in disease through proteomics: progress and potential Introduction: Protein prenylation is a ubiquitous covalent post-translational modification characterized by the addition of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid groups to a cysteine residue located near the carboxyl terminal of a protein. It is essential for the proper localization and cellular activity of numerous proteins, including Ras family GTPases and G-proteins. In addition to its roles in cellular physiology, the prenylation process has important implications in human diseases and in the recent years, it has become attractive target of inhibitors with therapeutic potential. Areas covered: This review attempts to summarize the basic aspects of prenylation integrating them with biological functions in diseases and giving an account of the current status of prenylation inhibitors as potential therapeutics. We also summarize the methodologies for the characterization of this modification. Expert commentary: The growing body of evidence suggesting an important role of prenylation in diseases and the subsequent development of inhibitors of the enzymes responsible for this modification lead to the urgent need to identify the full spectrum of prenylated proteins that are altered in the disease or affected by drugs. Proteomic tools to analyze prenylated proteins are recently emerging, thanks to the advancement in the field of mass spectrometry coupled to enrichment strategies. Proteomic studies of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: an update ABSTRACTIntroduction: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the brain. Today there are three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid-β consisting of 42 amino acids (Aβ42), total-tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), which combined have sensitivity and specificity figures around 80%. However, pathological studies have shown that comorbidity is a common feature in AD and that the three currently used CSF biomarkers do not optimally reflect the activity of the disease process. Thus, additional markers are needed.Areas covered: In the present review, we screened PubMed for articles published the last five years (2012–2017) for proteomic studies in CSF with the criteria that AD had to be included as one of the diagnostic groups. Based on inclusion criteria, 28 papers were included reporting in total 224 biomarker-data that were altered in AD compared to control. Both mass spectrometry and multi-panel immunoassays were considered as proteomic studies.Expert commentary: A ... Global variability in radiative-convective equilibrium with a slab ocean under a wide range of CO2 concentrations In radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), radiative cooling of the troposphere is roughly balanced by the vaporization enthalpy set free by precipitating moist convection. Many earlier studies restricted the investigation of RCE to the dynamics of the atmosphere with constant boundary conditions including prescribed surface temperature. We investigate a GCM setup where a slab ocean is coupled to the atmosphere, and we explore a wide range of CO2 concentrations. We obtain reliable statistical quantities from thousand-year-long simulations. For moderate CO2 concentrations, we find unskewed temporal variations of 1–2\\u2009K in global mean surface temperature, with an almost constant climate sensitivity of 2\\u2009K. At CO2 concentrations beyond four times the preindustrial value, the climate sensitivity decreases to nearly zero as a result of episodic global cooling events as large as 10\\u2009K. The dynamics of these cooling events are investigated in detail and shown to be associated with an increase in large-scale low-level stratiform cloudiness in the subsiding region, which is a result of penetrative shallow convection being capped by an inversion and thus not ventilating the lower troposphere. These dynamics depend on the CO2 concentration: both through the effect of temperature on stratification and through the changing spatial scale of organization of the flow, which determines the spatial scale and temporal coherence of the stratiform cloud sheets. Methods for predicting vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity ABSTRACT Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in bioinformatics. Here we described the four main steps to discover markers of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity: (1) Preparing the data; (2) Selecting the vaccinees and relevant genes; (3) Choosing the algorithm; (4) Blind testing your model. With the increasing number of Systems Vaccinology datasets being generated, we expect that the accuracy and robustness of signatures of vaccine reactogenicity and immunogenicity will significantly improve. The benefit of evolving multidisciplinary care in ALS: a diagnostic cohort survival comparison BACKGROUND\\\\ud \\\\ud Care for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has altered at King\\'s College Hospital over the last 20 years. The clinic has been a multidisciplinary, specialist, tertiary referral centre since 1995 with a large team with integrated palliative and respiratory care since 2006. We hypothesised that these changes would improve survival.\\\\ud \\\\ud METHODS\\\\ud \\\\ud In this retrospective observational study, patients diagnosed with El Escorial definite, probable and possible ALS between 1995-1998 and 2008-2011 were followed up. The primary outcome measure was a chi-square test for the proportion of each cohort surviving. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox multivariate regression were secondary analyses.\\\\ud \\\\ud RESULTS\\\\ud \\\\ud There was low reporting of some interventions. Five hundred and forty-seven people were included. Survival between the cohorts was significantly different (p\\u2009=\\u20090.022) with a higher proportion surviving during 2008-2011. Survival time was 21.6 (95% CI 19.2-24.0) months in the 2008-2011 cohort compared to 19.2 years (15.6-21.6) in the 1995-1998 cohort (log rank p\\u2009=\\u20090.018). Four hundred and ninety-three cases were included in the Cox regression. Diagnostic cohort was a significant predictor variable (HR 0.79 (0.64-0.97) p\\u2009=\\u20090.023).\\\\ud \\\\ud CONCLUSIONS\\\\ud \\\\ud These results support the hypothesis that integrated specialist clinics with multidisciplinary input improve survival in ALS. A standard operating procedure for King’s ALS clinical staging Abstract Objective: Clinical stages in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be measured using a simple system based on the number of CNS regions involved and requirement for gastrostomy or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). We aimed to design a standard operating procedure (SOP) to define the standardized use and application of the King’s staging system. Methods: We designed a SOP for the King’s staging system. We wrote case vignettes representative of ALS patients at different disease stages. During two workshops, we taught health care professionals how to use the SOP, then asked them to stage the vignettes using the SOP. We measured the extent to which SOP staging corresponded with correct clinical stage. Results: The reliability of staging using the SOP was excellent, with a Spearman’s Rank coefficient of 0.95 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and was high for different groups of health care professionals, and for those with different levels of experience in ALS. The limits of agreement between SOP staging and actual clinical stage lie within a single stage, confirming that there is a clinically acceptable level of agreement between staging using the SOP and actual King’s clinical stage. There were also no systematic biases of the SOP over the range of stages, either for over-staging or under-staging. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the staging SOP provides a reliable method of calculating clinical stages in ALS patients and can be used prospectively by a range of health care professionals with different levels of experience, as for example may be the case in multicentre clinical trials. ALSgeneScanner: a pipeline for the analysis and interpretation of DNA sequencing data of ALS patients Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, MND) is a neurodegenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons resulting in death from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within two years of first symptoms. Genetic factors are an important cause of ALS, with variants in more than 25 genes having strong evidence, and weaker evidence available for variants in more than 120 genes. With the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing data, non-specialists, including health care professionals and patients, are obtaining their genomic information without a corresponding ability to analyze and interpret it. Furthermore, the relevance of novel or existing variants in ALS genes is not always apparent. Here we present ALSgeneScanner, a tool that is easy to install and use, able to provide an automatic, detailed, annotated report, on a list of ALS genes from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in a few hours and whole exome sequence data in about 1\\u2009h on a readily available mid-range computer. This will be of value to non-specialists and aid in the interpretation of the relevance of novel and existing variants identified in DNA sequencing data. Transmission potential of African, Asian and American Zika virus strains by Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus from Guadeloupe (French West Indies) International audience; Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that has dramatically spread in South America and the Caribbean regions since 2015. The majority of vector incrimination studies available for ZIKV showed that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors for this virus. However, several reports suggest that Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes may be implicated in ZIKV transmission in certain urban settings. In the present study, we evaluated the vector competence for ZIKV of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Guadeloupe using African, American and Asian strains. The results demonstrated that Cx. quinquefasciatus is refractory to ZIKV infection whatever the strain tested at 7, 14 or 21 days post-infection (dpi), while ZIKV transmission was recorded in Ae. aegypti for all the three strains. The African ZIKV strain was better transmitted by Ae. aegypti (∼ 50% mean transmission efficiency) and with a shorter incubation period (7 dpi) when compared to the Asian and American strains (<14% transmission efficiency; incubation period of 14–21 dpi). Taken together, these results suggest that only Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are involved in urban ZIKV transmission in Guadeloupe and highlight a higher infectiousness of the African ZIKV strain in this mosquito species when compared to the Asian and American ones. A novel mouse model identifies cooperating mutations and therapeutic targets critical for chronic myeloid leukemia progression The introduction of highly selective ABL-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, TKIs are only efficacious in the chronic phase of the disease and effective therapies for TKI-refractory CML, or after progression to blast crisis (BC), are lacking. Whereas the chronic phase of CML is dependent on BCR-ABL, additional mutations are required for progression to BC. However, the identity of these mutations and the pathways they affect are poorly understood, hampering our ability to identify therapeutic targets and improve outcomes. Here, we describe a novel mouse model that allows identification of mechanisms of BC progression in an unbiased and tractable manner, using transposon-based insertional mutagenesis on the background of chronic phase CML. Our BC model is the first to faithfully recapitulate the phenotype, cellular and molecular biology of human CML progression. We report a heterogeneous and unique pattern of insertions identifying known and novel candidate genes and demonstrate that these pathways drive disease progression and provide potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. Our model greatly informs the biology of CML progression and provides a potent resource for the development of candidate therapies to improve the dismal outcomes in this highly aggressive disease. Contrasting requirements during disease evolution identify EZH2 as a therapeutic target in AML Epigenetic regulators, such as EZH2, are frequently mutated in cancer, and loss-of-function EZH2 mutations are common in myeloid malignancies. We have examined the importance of cellular context for Ezh2 loss during the evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where we observed stage-specific and diametrically opposite functions for Ezh2 at the early and late stages of disease. During disease maintenance, WT Ezh2 exerts an oncogenic function that may be therapeutically targeted. In contrast, Ezh2 acts as a tumor suppressor during AML induction. Transcriptional analysis explains this apparent paradox, demonstrating that loss of Ezh2 derepresses different expression programs during disease induction and maintenance. During disease induction, Ezh2 loss derepresses a subset of bivalent promoters that resolve toward gene activation, inducing a feto-oncogenic program that includes genes such as Plag1, whose overexpression phenocopies Ezh2 loss to accelerate AML induction in mouse models. Our data highlight the importance of cellular context and disease phase for the function of Ezh2 and its potential therapeutic implications. Stochastic Evolutionary Demography under a Fluctuating Optimum Phenotype Many natural populations exhibit temporal fluctuations in abundance that are consistent with external forcing by a randomly changing environment. As fitness emerges from an interaction between the phenotype and the environment, such demographic fluctuations probably include a substantial contribution from fluctuating phenotypic selection. We study the stochastic population dynamics of a population exposed to random (plus possibly directional) changes in the optimum phenotype for a quantitative trait that evolves in response to this moving optimum. We derive simple analytical predictions for the distribution of log-population size over time, both transiently and at stationarity under Gompertz density regulation. These predictions are well matched by population- and individual-based simulations. The log-population size is approximately reverse gamma distributed, with a negative skew causing an excess of low relative to high population sizes, thus increasing extinction risk relative to a symmetric (e.g. normal) distribution with the same mean and variance. Our analysis reveals how the mean and variance of log population size change with the variance and autocorrelation of deviations of the evolving mean phenotype from the optimum. We apply our results to the analysis of evolutionary rescue in a stochastic environment, and show that random fluctuations in the optimum can substantially increase extinction risk, by both reducing the expected growth rate and increasing the variance of population size by several orders of magnitude. Maladaptive Shifts in Life History in a Changing Environment International audience; Many species facing climate change have complex life cycles , with individuals in different stages differing in their sensitivity to a changing climate and their contribution to population growth. We use a quantitative genetics model to predict the dynamics of adaptation in a stage-structured population confronted with a steadily changing environment. Our model assumes that different optimal phenotypic values maximize different fitness components, consistent with many empirical observations. In a constant environment, the population evolves toward an equilibrium phenotype, which represents the best compromise given the trade-off between vital rates. In a changing environment, however, the mean phenotype in the population will lag behind this optimal compromise. We show that this lag may result in a shift along the trade-off between vital rates, with negative consequences for some fitness components but, less intuitively, improvements in some others. Complex eco-evolutionary dynamics can emerge in our model due to feedbacks between population demography and adaptation. Because of such feedback loops, selection may favor further shifts in life history in the same direction as those caused by maladaptive lags. These shifts in life history could be wrongly interpreted as adaptations to the new environment, while in reality they only reflect the inability of the population to adapt fast enough. SQUIDs in biomagnetism: a roadmap towards improved healthcare Globally, the demand for improved health care delivery while managing escalating costs is a major challenge. Measuring the biomagnetic fields that emanate from the human brain already impacts the treatment of epilepsy, brain tumours and other brain disorders. This roadmap explores how superconducting technologies are poised to impact health care. Biomagnetism is the study of magnetic fields of biological origin. Biomagnetic fields are typically very weak, often in the femtotesla range, making their measurement challenging. The earliest in vivo human measurements were made with room-temperature coils. In 1963, Baule and McFee (1963 Am. Heart J. 55 95-6) reported the magnetic field produced by electric currents in the heart (\\'magnetocardiography\\'), and in 1968, Cohen (1968 Science 161 784-6) described the magnetic field generated by alpha-rhythm currents in the brain (\\'magnetoencephalography\\'). Subsequently, in 1970, Cohen et al (1970 Appl. Phys. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. Lett. 16 278-80) reported the recording of a magnetocardiogram using a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID). Just two years later, in 1972, Cohen (1972 Science 175 664-6) described the use of a SQUID in magnetoencephalography. These last two papers set the scene for applications of SQUIDs in biomagnetism, the subject of this roadmap. The SQUID is a combination of two fundamental properties of superconductors. The first is flux quantization - the fact that the magnetic flux Φ in a closed superconducting loop is quantized in units of the magnetic flux quantum, Φ0 ≡ h/2e, ≈ 2.07 × 10-15 Tm2 (Deaver and Fairbank 1961 Phys.

The second property is the Josephson effect, predicted in 1962 by Josephson (1962 Phys. 1 251-3) and observed by Anderson and Rowell (1963 Phys. 10 230-2) in 1963. The Josephson junction consists of two weakly coupled superconductors separated by a tunnel barrier or other weak link. A tiny electriccurrent is able to flow between the superconductors as a supercurrent, without developing a voltage across them. At currents above the \\'critical current\\' (maximum supercurrent), however, a voltage is developed. In 1964, Jaklevic et al (1964 Phys. 12 159-60) observed quantum interference between two Josephson junctions connected in series on a superconducting loop, giving birth to the dc SQUID. The essential property of the SQUID is that a steady increase in the magnetic flux threading the loop causes the critical current to oscillate with a period of one flux quantum. In today\\'s SQUIDs, using conventional semiconductor readout electronics, one can typically detect a change in Φ corresponding to 10-6 Φ0 in one second. Although early practical SQUIDs were usually made from bulk superconductors, for example, niobium or Pb-Sn solder blobs, today\\'s devices are invariably made from thin superconducting films patterned with photolithography or even electron lithography. An extensive description of SQUIDsand their applications can be found in the SQUID Handbooks (Clarke and Braginski 2004 Fundamentals and Technology of SQUIDs and SQUID Systems vol I (Weinheim, Germany: Wiley-VCH), Clarke and Braginski 2006 Applications of SQUIDs and SQUID Systems vol II (Weinheim, Germany: Wiley-VCH)). The roadmap begins (chapter 1) with a brief review of the state-of-the-art of SQUID-based magnetometers and gradiometers for biomagnetic measurements. The magnetic field noise referred to the pick-up loop is typically a few fT Hz-1/2, often limited by noise in the metallized thermal insulation of the dewar rather than by intrinsic SQUID noise. The authors describe a pathway to achieve an intrinsic magnetic field noise as low as 0.1 fT Hz-1/2, approximately the Nyquist noise of the human body. They also descibe a technology to defeat dewar noise. Chapter 2 reviews the neuroscientific and clinical use of magnetoencephalography (MEG), by far the most widespread application of biomagnetism with systems containing typically 300 sensors cooled to liquid-helium temperature, 4.2 K. Two important clinical applications are presurgical mapping of focal epilepsy and of eloquent cortex in brain-tumor patients. Reducing the sensor-to-brain separation and the system noise level would both improve spatial resolution. The very recent commercial innovation that replaces the need for frequent manual transfer of liquid helium with an automated system that collects and liquefies the gas and transfers the liquid to the dewar will make MEG systems more accessible. A highly promising means of placing the sensors substantially closer to the scalp for MEG is to use high-transition-temperature (high-T c) SQUID sensors and flux transformers (chapter 3). Operation of these devices at liquid-nitrogen temperature, 77 K, enables one to minimize or even omit metallic thermal insulation between the sensors and the dewar. Noise levels of a few fT Hz-1/2 have already been achieved, and lower values are likely. The dewars can be made relatively flexible, and thus able to be placed close to the skull irrespective of the size of the head, potentially providing higher spatial resolution than liquid-helium based systems. The successful realization of a commercial high-T c MEG system would have a major commercial impact. Chapter 4 introduces the concept of SQUID-based ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging (ULF MRI) operating at typically several kHz, some four orders of magnitude lower than conventional, clinical MRI machines. Potential advantages of ULF MRI include higher image contrast than for conventional MRI, enabling methodologies not currently available. Examples include screening for cancer without a contrast agent, imaging traumatic brain injury (TBI) and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s, and determining the elapsed time since a stroke. The major current problem with ULF MRI is that its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low compared with high-field MRI. Realistic solutions to this problem are proposed, including implementing sensors with a noise level of 0.1 fT Hz-1/2. A logical and exciting prospect (chapter 5) is to combine MEG and ULF MRI into a single system in which both signal sources are detected with the same array of SQUIDs. A prototype system is described. The combination of MEG and ULF MRI allows one to obtain structural images of the head concurrently with the recording of brain activity. Since all MEG images require an MRI to determine source locations underlying the MEG signal, the combined modality would give a precise registration of the two images; the combination of MEG with high-field MRI can produce registration errors as large as 5 mm. The use of multiple sensors for ULF MRI increases both the SNR and the field of view. Chapter 6 describes another potentially far-reaching application of ULF MRI, namely neuronal current imaging (NCI) of the brain. Currently available neuronal imaging techniques include MEG, which is fast but has relatively poor spatial resolution, perhaps 10 mm, and functional MRI (fMRI) which has a millimeter resolution but is slow, on the order of seconds, and furthermore does not directly measure neuronal signals. NCI combines the ability of direct measurement of MEG with the spatial precision of MRI. In essence, the magnetic fields generated by neural currents shift the frequency of the magnetic resonance signal at a location that is imaged by the three-dimensional magnetic field gradients that form the basis of MRI. The currently achieved sensitivity of NCI is not quite sufficient to realize its goal, but it is close. The realization of NCI would represent a revolution in functional brain imaging. Improved techniques for immunoassay are always being sought, and chapter 7 introduces an entirely new topic, magnetic nanoparticles for immunoassay. These particles are bio-funtionalized, for example with a specific antibody which binds to its corresponding antigen, if it is present. Any resulting changes in the properties of the nanoparticles are detected with a SQUID. For liquid-phase detection, there are three basic methods: AC susceptibility, magnetic relaxation and remanence measurement. These methods, which have been successfully implemented for both in vivo and ex vivo applications, are highly sensitive and, although further development is required, it appears highly likely that at least some of them will be commercialized. Peer reviewed A modular, extendible and field-tolerant multichannel vector magnetometer based on current sensor SQUIDs We present the prototype module of our extendible and robust multichannel SQUID magnetometer system. A multi-module arrangement can be implemented by using up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision measurements of biomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are magnetorelaxometry and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR), where pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are typically applied. The system is operated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped with 18 magnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) wire-wound pick-up coils. A total of 16 small pick-up coils with 17.1 mm diameter form a regular grid with individual channels arranged to ensure system sensitivity covers all three orthogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal pick-up coils with an equivalent diameter of 74.5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at two different heights and are suitable for the detection of deep sources. Each coil is connected to the input of a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a detachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped with integrated input current limiters. Feedback into the pick-up coils minimizes crosstalk between channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting shield of Nb. The field distortion of the prototype and a multi-module arrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured noise of the small magnetometers was between 0.6 and 1.5 fT/Hz_$^{1/2}_$, and well below 1 fT/Hz_$^{1/2}_$ for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a minimum noise level of 0.54 fT/Hz_$^{1/2}_$. We performed ULF NMR experiments, verifying the system\\'s robustness against pulsed fields, and magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The low noise performance of our 18-channel prototype enabled the detection of high-frequency components at around 1 kHz by MEG. Global stability properties of the climate: Melancholia states, invariant measures, and phase transitions For a wide range of values of the incoming solar radiation, the Earth features at least two attracting states, which correspond to competing climates. The warm climate is analogous to the present one; the snowball climate features global glaciation and conditions that can hardly support life forms. Paleoclimatic evidences suggest that in the past our planet flipped between these two states. The main physical mechanism responsible for such an instability is the ice-albedo feedback. In a previous work, we defined the Melancholia states that sit between the two climates. Such states are embedded in the boundaries between the two basins of attraction and feature extensive glaciation down to relatively low latitudes. Here, we explore the global stability properties of the system by introducing random perturbations as modulations to the intensity of the incoming solar radiation. We observe noise-induced transitions between the competing basins of attraction. In the weak noise limit, large deviation laws define the invariant measure, the statistics of escape times, and typical escape paths called instantons. By constructing the instantons empirically, we show that the Melancholia states are the gateways for the noise-induced transitions. In the region of multistability, in the zero-noise limit, the measure is supported only on one of the competing attractors. For low (high) values of the solar irradiance, the limit measure is the snowball (warm) climate. The changeover between the two regimes corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the system. The framework we propose seems of general relevance for the study of complex multistable systems. Finally, we put forward a new method for constructing Melancholia states from direct numerical simulations, black which provides a possible alternative with respect to the edge-tracking algorithm. Side-wall spacer passivated sub-μm Josephson junction fabrication process We present a structure and a fabrication method for superconducting tunnel junctions down to the dimensions of 200 nm using i-line UV lithography. The key element is a side-wall-passivating spacer structure (SWAPS) which is shaped for smooth crossline contacting and low parasitic capacitance. The SWAPS structure enables formation of junctions with dimensions at or below the lithography-limited linewidth. An additional benefit is avoiding the excessive use of amorphous dielectric materials which is favorable in sub-Kelvin microwave applications often plagued by nonlinear and lossy dielectrics. We apply the structure to niobium trilayer junctions, and provide characterization results yielding evidence on wafer-scale scalability, and critical current density tuning in the range of 0.1 -- 3.0 kA/cm_$^2_$. We discuss the applicability of the junction process in the context of different applications, such as, SQUID magnetometers and Josephson parametric amplifiers. Impact of the reference choice on scalp EEG connectivity estimation Several scalp EEG functional connectivity studies, mostly clinical, seem to overlook the reference electrode impact. The subsequent interpretation of brain connectivity is thus often biased by the choice a non-neutral reference. This study aims at systematically investigating these effects. As EEG reference, we examined: the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally linked mastoids (DLM), the average reference (AVE), and the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST). As a connectivity metric, we used the imaginary part of coherency. We tested simulated and real data (eyes open resting state), by evaluating the influence of electrode density, effect of head model accuracy in the REST transformation, and impact on the characterization of the topology of functional networks from graph analysis. Simulations demonstrated that REST significantly reduced the distortion of connectivity patterns when compared to AVE, Cz and DLM references. Moreover, the availability of high-density EEG systems and an accurate knowledge of the head model are crucial elements to improve REST performance. For real data, a systematic change of the spatial pattern of functional connectivity depending on the chosen reference was also observed. The distortion of connectivity patterns was larger for the Cz reference, and progressively decreases when using the DLM, the AVE, the REST. Strikingly, we also showed that network attributes derived from graph analysis, i.e., node degree and local efficiency, are significantly influenced by the EEG reference choice. Overall, this study highlights that significant differences arise in scalp EEG functional connectivity and graph network properties, in dependence of the chosen reference. We hope our study will convey the message that caution should be taken when interpreting and comparing results obtained from different laboratories when using different reference schemes. Increased importance of methane reduction for a 1.5 degree target To understand the importance of methane on the levels of carbon emission reductions required to achieve temperature goals, a processed-based approach is necessary rather than reliance on the transient climate response to emissions. We show that plausible levels of methane (CH ) mitigation can make a substantial difference to the feasibility of achieving the Paris climate targets through increasing the allowable carbon emissions. This benefit is enhanced by the indirect effects of CH on ozone (O ). Here the differing effects of CH and CO on land carbon storage, including the effects of surface O , lead to an additional increase in the allowable carbon emissions with CH mitigation. We find a simple robust relationship between the change in the 2100 CH concentration and the extra allowable cumulative carbon emissions between now and 2100 (0.27 ± 0.05 GtC per ppb CH ). This relationship is independent of modelled climate sensitivity and precise temperature target, although later mitigation of CH reduces its value and thus methane reduction effectiveness. Up to 12% of this increase in allowable emissions is due to the effect of surface ozone. We conclude early mitigation of CH emissions would significantly increase the feasibility of stabilising global warming below 1.5 °C, alongside having co-benefits for human and ecosystem health. 4 4 3 4 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 Equilibrium forest demography explains the distribution of tree sizes across North America The distribution of tree sizes within a forest strongly influences how it will respond to disturbances and environmental changes such as future climate change and increases in atmospheric CO2. This means that global vegetation models must include variation in tree size to accurately represent carbon sinks, such as that seen in North America. Here we use an analytical model of large-scale forest demography which assumes tree growth varies as a power of tree diameter whilst tree mortality is independent of size. The equilibrium solutions of this model are able to accurately reproduce the tree-size distributions, for 61 species and four plant functional types, measured across North America, using just a single species-specific fitting parameter, μ, which determines the ratio of mortality to growth. The predictions of metabolic scaling theory for tree-size distributions are also tested and found to deviate significantly from observations and that maybe explained by the assumptions made about how individual trees fill the available space. We show that equilibrium forest demography implies a single curve that relates mean tree diameter to μ, and that this can be used to make reasonable estimates of the whole dataset mean trunk diameter by fitting only to the larger trees. Our analysis suggests that analytical solutions such as those in this paper may have a role in aiding the understanding and development of next-generation Dynamic Global Vegetation Models based on ecosystem demography. A new approach for assessing synergies of solar and wind power: implications for West Africa West African countries\\' energy and climate policies show a pronounced focus on decarbonising power supply through renewable electricity (RE) generation. In particular, most West African states explicitly focus on hybrid mixes of variable renewable power sources—solar, wind and hydropower—in their targets for the electricity sector. Hydropower, the main current RE resource in West Africa, is strongly sensitive to monsoon rainfall variability, which has led to power crises in the past. Therefore, solar and wind power could play a stronger role in the future as countries move to power systems with high shares of RE. Considering the policy focus on diversified RE portfolios, there is a strong need to provide climate services for assessing how these resources could function together in a power mix. In this study, climate data from the state-of-the-art ERA5 reanalysis is used to assess the synergies of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power potential in West Africa at hourly resolution. A new metric, the stability coefficient C_stab, is developed to quantify the synergies of solar PV and wind power for achieving a balanced power output and limiting storage needs. Using this metric, it is demonstrated that there is potential for exploiting hybrid solar/wind power in a larger area of West Africa, covering more important centers of population and closer to existing grid structures, than would be suggested by average maps of solar and wind resource availability or capacity factor for the region. The results of this study highlight why multi-scale temporal synergies of power mixes should be considered in RE system planning from the start. ispartof: Environmental Research Letters vol:13 issue:9 pages:1-11 status: published Global energy growth is outpacing decarbonization Recent reports have highlighted the challenge of keeping global average temperatures below 2 °C and—even more so—1.5 °C (IPCC 2018). Fossil-fuel burning and cement production release ~90% of all CO2 emissions from human activities. After a three-year hiatus with stable global emissions (Jackson et al 2016; Le Quere C et al 2018a ; IEA 2018), CO2 emissions grew by 1.6% in 2017 to 36.2 Gt (billion tonnes), and are expected to grow a further 2.7% in 2018 (range: 1.8%–3.7%) to a record 37.1 ± 2 Gt CO2 (Le Quere et al 2018b). Additional increases in 2019 remain uncertain but appear likely because of persistent growth in oil and natural gas use and strong growth projected for the global economy. Coal use has slowed markedly in the last few years, potentially peaking, but its future trajectory remains uncertain. Despite positive progress in ~19 countries whose economies have grown over the last decade and their emissions have declined, growth in energy use from fossil-fuel sources is still outpacing the rise of low-carbon sources and activities. A robust global economy, insufficient emission reductions in developed countries, and a need for increased energy use in developing countries where per capita emissions remain far below those of wealthier nations will continue to put upward pressure on CO2 emissions. Peak emissions will occur only when total fossil CO2 emissions finally start to decline despite growth in global energy consumption, with fossil energy production replaced by rapidly growing low- or no-carbon technologies. Integrated policy assessment and optimisation over multiple sustainable development goals in Eastern Africa Heavy reliance on traditional biomass for household energy in eastern Africa has significant negative health and environmental impacts. The African context for energy access is rather different from historical experiences elsewhere as challenges in achieving energy access have coincided with major climate ambitions. Policies focusing on household energy needs in eastern Africa contribute to at least three sustainable development goals (SDGs): climate action, good health, and improved energy access. This study uses an integrated assessment model to simulate the impact of land policies and technology subsidies, as well as the interaction of both, on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exposure to air pollution and energy access in eastern Africa under a range of socioeconomic pathways. We find that land policies focusing on increasing the sustainable output of biomass resources can reduce GHG emissions in the region by about 10%, but also slightly delay progress in health and energy access goals. An optimised portfolio of energy technology subsidies consistent with a global Green Climate Funds budget of 30–35 billion dollar, can yield another 10% savings in GHG emissions, while decreasing mortality related to air pollution by 20%, and improving energy access by up to 15%. After 2030, both land and technology policies become less effective, and more dependent on the overall development path of the region. The analysis shows that support for biogas technology should be prioritised in both the short and long term, while financing liquefied petroleum gas and ethanol technologies also has synergetic climate, health and energy access benefits. Instead, financing PV technologies is mostly relevant for improving energy access, while charcoal and to a lesser extend fuelwood technologies are relevant for curbing GHG emissions if their finance is linked to land policies. We suggest that integrated policy analysis is needed in the African context for simultaneously reaching progress in multiple SDGs.

Causes of climate change over the historical record This review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms. Cold waves are getting milder in the northern midlatitudes The strong two-day cold wave in the midwestern United States in January 2019 again ignited the discussion as to whether cold waves are getting more severe or not as a result of Arctic amplification due to climate change. Assessing the evolution of cold waves in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes in the observations has been difficult because the variability of cold waves is large compared to anthropogenic warming. In order to detect changes in cold spells, two complementary ways to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio are employed: multi-decadal series at individual stations, and for shorter time periods by using spatially aggregated measures. Global warming is now strong enough to make trends clear at individual stations when considering long enough (>50 yr) records of daily minimum and maximum temperature. Calculating the land area that has temperatures below the 1-in-10 year return value (defined over 1951–1980) enables us to investigate trends over a shorter time horizon. The long-term station data have strong decreases everywhere in the lowest minimum temperature. Warming trends in the lowest maximum temperature are smaller over most of the Northern Hemisphere, with dataset-dependent indications of possible negative trends in parts of the United States and Mexico. Considering the area experiencing cold waves over the last decades, the most notable feature is a sharp decline of this area since the 1980s. The natural variability is still so large that it is possible to arbitrarily select starting dates after the decline for which the trend is slightly positive in smaller regions like North America or Europe. However, these values are within uncertainties compatible with a steady decline and have differing starting dates in North America and Europe. An analysis of the entire northern midlatitudes confirms the steady decrease in severity and frequency of cold waves over the last decades in the observations. Quantifying uncertainty in European climate projections using combined performance-independence weighting Uncertainty in model projections of future climate change arises due to internal variability, multiple possible emission scenarios, and different model responses to anthropogenic forcing. To robustly quantify uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, inter-dependencies between models as well as a models ability to reproduce observations should be considered. Here, a model weighting approach, which accounts for both independence and performance, is applied to European temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP5 archive. Two future periods representing mid- and end-of-century conditions driven by the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 are investigated. To inform the weighting, six diagnostics based on three observational estimates are used to also account for uncertainty in the observational record. Our findings show that weighting the ensemble can reduce the interquartile spread by more than 20% in some regions, increasing the reliability of projected changes. The mean temperature change is most notably impacted by the weighting in the Mediterranean, where it is found to be 0.35 °C higher than the unweighted mean in the end-of-century period. For precipitation the largest differences are found for Northern Europe, with a relative decrease in precipitation of 2.4% and 3.4% for the two future periods compared to the unweighted case. Based on a perfect model test, it is found that weighting the ensemble leads to an increase in the investigated skill score for temperature and precipitation while minimizing the probability of overfitting. ISSN:1748-9326 ISSN:1748-9318 Persistent fossil fuel growth threatens the Paris Agreement and planetary health Amidst declarations of planetary emergency and reports that the window for limiting climate change to 1.5 °C is rapidly closing, global average temperatures and fossil fuel emissions continue to rise. Global fossil CO2 emissions have grown three years consecutively: +1.5% in 2017, +2.1% in 2018, and our slower central projection of +0.6% in 2019 (range of –0.32% to 1.5%) to 37 ± 2 Gt CO2 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data accepted), after a temporary growth hiatus from 2014 to 2016. Economic indicators and trends in global natural gas and oil use suggest a further rise in emissions in 2020 is likely. CO2 emissions are decreasing slowly in many industrialized regions, including the European Union (preliminary estimate of −1.7% [–3.4% to +0.1%] for 2019, −0.8%/yr for 2003–2018) and United States (−1.7% [–3.7% to +0.3%] in 2019, −0.8%/yr for 2003–2018), while emissions continue growing in India (+1.8% [+0.7% to 3.7%] in 2019, +5.1%/yr for 2003–2018), China (+2.6% [+0.7% to 4.4%] in 2019, +0.4%/yr for 2003–2018), and rest of the world ((+0.5% [−0.8% to 1.8%] in 2019, +1.4%/yr for 2003–2018). Two under-appreciated trends suggest continued long-term growth in both oil and natural gas use is likely. Because per capita oil consumption in the US and Europe remains 5- to 20-fold higher than in China and India, increasing vehicle ownership and air travel in Asia are poised to increase global CO2 emissions from oil over the next decade or more. Liquified natural gas exports from Australia and the United States are surging, lowering natural gas prices in Asia and increasing global access to this fossil resource. To counterbalance increasing emissions, we need accelerated energy efficiency improvements and reduced consumption, rapid deployment of electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage technologies, and a decarbonized electricity grid, with new renewable capacities replacing fossil fuels, not supplementing them. Stronger global commitments and carbon pricing would help implement such policies at scale and in time.

SIRT1 Controls Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity by Modulating Inflammation and Oxidative Stress Aims: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a key player in liver physiology and a therapeutic target against hepatic inflammation. We evaluated the role of SIRT1 in the proinflammatory context and oxidative stress during acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated hepatotoxicity. Results: SIRT1 protein levels decreased in human and mouse livers following APAP overdose. SIRT1-Tg mice maintained higher levels of SIRT1 on APAP injection than wild-type mice and were protected against hepatotoxicity by modulation of antioxidant systems and restrained inflammatory responses, with decreased oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine messenger RNA levels, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling, and cell death. Mouse hepatocytes stimulated with conditioned medium of APAP-treated macrophages (APAP-CM) showed decreased SIRT1 levels; an effect mimicked by interleukin (IL)1β, an activator of NFκB. This negative modulation was abolished by neutralizing IL1β in APAP-CM or silencing p65-NFκB in hepatocytes. APAP-CM of macrophages from SIRT1-Tg mice failed to downregulate SIRT1 protein levels in hepatocytes. In vivo administration of the NFκB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 preserved SIRT1 levels and protected from APAP-mediated hepatotoxicity. Innovation: Our work evidenced the unique role of SIRT1 in APAP hepatoprotection by targeting oxidative stress and inflammation. Conclusion: SIRT1 protein levels are downregulated by IL1β/NFκB signaling in APAP hepatotoxicity, resulting in inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, maintenance of SIRT1 during APAP overdose by inhibiting NFκB might be clinically relevant.

Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 1187-1208. Nuclear Factor Kappa B Signaling Complexes in Acute Inflammation Significance: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a master regulator of the inflammatory response and represents a key regulatory node in the complex inflammatory signaling network. In addition, selective NF-κB transcriptional activity on specific target genes occurs through the control of redox-sensitive NF-κB interactions. Recent Advances: The selective NF-κB response is mediated by redox-modulated NF-κB complexes with ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), Pirin (PIR). cAMP response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), activator protein-1 (AP-1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1), and SP-1. NF-κB is cooperatively coactivated with AP-1, STAT3, EGR-1, and SP-1 during the inflammatory process, whereas NF-κB complexes with CBP/p300 and PGC-1α regulate the expression of antioxidant genes. PGC-1α may act as selective repressor of phospho-p65 toward interleukin-6 (IL-6) in acute inflammation. p65 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) compete for binding to coactivator CBP/p300 playing opposite roles in the regulation of inflammatory genes. S-nitrosylation or tyrosine nitration favors the recruitment of specific NF-κB subunits to κB sites. Critical Issues: NF-κB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that forms specific signaling complexes to regulate selectively the expression of target genes in acute inflammation. Protein-protein interactions with coregulatory proteins, other transcription factors, and chromatin-remodeling proteins provide transcriptional specificity to NF-κB. Furthermore, different NF-κB subunits may form distinct redox-sensitive homo- and heterodimers with distinct affinities for κB sites. Future Directions: Further research is required to elucidate the whole NF-κB interactome to fully characterize the complex NF-κB signaling network in redox signaling, inflammation, and cancer. Serum Neurofilament Light Protein as a Marker for Diffuse Axonal Injury: Results from a Case Series Study Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is an important cause of morbidity in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is currently no simple and reliable technique for early identification of patients with DAI, or to prognosticate long-term outcome in this patient group. In the present study, we examined acute serum concentrations of neurofilament light (NFL) in nine patients with severe TBI and DAI using a novel ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) assay. The relationships between the NFL concentrations and MRI in the acute stage as well as clinical outcome and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) parameters at 12 months were analyzed. We found that the mean NFL concentrations among the patients displayed a 30-fold increase compared with controls, and that NFL completely discriminated between the patients and controls. We also found a relationship between serum NFL and MR-DTI parameters, with higher NFL concentrations in patients with higher trace (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.79) and lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (R 2\\u2009=\\u20090.83). These results suggest that serum NFL may be a valuable blood biomarker for TBI, reflecting the severity of DAI. Performance Ratio Based Resource Allocation Decision-Making in Genomic Medicine In modern healthcare systems, the available resources may influence the morbidity, mortality, and-consequently-the level of healthcare provided in every country. This is of particular interest in developing countries where the resources are limited and must be spent wisely to address social justice and the right for equal access in healthcare services by all the citizens in economically viable terms. In this light, the current allocation is, in practice, inefficient and rests mostly on each country\\'s individual political and historical context and, thus, does not always incorporate decision-making enabled by economic models. In this study, we present a new economic model, specifically for resource allocation for genomic medicine, based on performance ratio, with potential applications in diverse healthcare sectors, which are particularly appealing for developing countries and low-resource environments. The model proposes a new method for resource allocation taking into account (1) the size of innovation of a new technology, (2) the relative effectiveness in comparison with social preferences, and (3) the cost of the technology, which permits the measurement of effectiveness to be determined differently in the context of a specific disease and then to be expressed in a relative form using a common performance ratio. The present work expands on previous work for innovation in economic models pertaining to genomic medicine and supports translational science. Pharmacometabolomics Informs Quantitative Radiomics for Glioblastoma Diagnostic Innovation Applications of omics systems biology technologies have enormous promise for radiology and diagnostics in surgical fields. In this context, the emerging fields of radiomics (a systems scale approach to radiology using a host of technologies, including omics) and pharmacometabolomics (use of metabolomics for patient and disease stratification and guiding precision medicine) offer much synergy for diagnostic innovation in surgery, particularly in neurosurgery. This synthesis of omics fields and applications is timely because diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors still challenges decision-making. Considering the vast heterogeneity in brain tumors, disease phenotypes, and interindividual variability in surgical and chemotherapy outcomes, we believe that diagnostic accuracy can be markedly improved by quantitative radiomics coupled to pharmacometabolomics and related health information technologies while optimizing economic costs of traditional diagnostics. In this expert review, we present an innovation analysis on a systems-level multi-omics approach toward diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors. For this, we suggest that glioblastomas serve as a useful application paradigm. We performed a literature search on PubMed for articles published in English between 2006 and 2016. We used the search terms \"radiomics,\" \"glioblastoma,\" \"biomarkers,\" \"pharmacogenomics,\" \"pharmacometabolomics,\" \"pharmacometabonomics/pharmacometabolomics,\" \"collaborative informatics,\" and \"precision medicine\". A list of the top 4 insights we derived from this literature analysis is presented in this study. For example, we found that (i) tumor grading needs to be better refined, (ii) diagnostic precision should be improved, (iii) standardization in radiomics is lacking, and (iv) quantitative radiomics needs to prove clinical implementation. We conclude with an interdisciplinary call to the metabolomics, pharmacy/pharmacology, radiology, and surgery communities that pharmacometabolomics coupled to information technologies (chemoinformatics tools, databases, collaborative systems) can inform quantitative radiomics, thus translating Big Data and information growth to knowledge growth, rational drug development and diagnostics innovation for glioblastomas, and possibly in other brain tumors. Enhanced Ex Vivo Generation of Erythroid Cells from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in a Simplified Cell Culture System with Low Cytokine Support Red blood cell (RBC) differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offers great potential for developmental studies and innovative therapies. However, ex vivo erythropoiesis from hiPSCs is currently limited by low efficiency and unphysiological conditions of common culture systems. Especially, the absence of a physiological niche may impair cell growth and lineage-specific differentiation. We here describe a simplified, xeno- and feeder-free culture system for prolonged RBC generation that uses low numbers of supporting cytokines [stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin (EPO), and interleukin 3 (IL-3)] and is based on the intermediate development of a “hematopoietic cell forming complex (HCFC).” From this HCFC, CD43+ hematopoietic cells (purity >95%) were continuously released into the supernatant and could be collected repeatedly over a period of 6 weeks for further erythroid differentiation. The released cells were mainly CD34+/CD45+ progenitors with high erythroid colony-forming potential and CD36+ erythroid precursors. A total of 1.5\\u2009×\\u2009107 cells could be harvested from the supernatant of one six-well plate, showing 100- to 1000-fold amplification during subsequent homogeneous differentiation into GPA+ erythroid cells. Mean enucleation rates near 40% (up to 60%) further confirmed the potency of the system. These benefits may be explained by the generation of a niche within the HCFC that mimics the spatiotemporal signaling of the physiological microenvironment in which erythropoiesis occurs. Compared to other protocols, this method provides lower complexity, less cytokine and medium consumption, higher cellular output, and better enucleation. In addition, slight modifications in cytokine addition shift the system toward continuous generation of granulocytes and macrophages. Real-Time Assessment of Health-Care Requirements During the Zika Virus Epidemic in Martinique International audience; The spread of Zika virus in the Americas has been associated with a surge in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases. Given the severity of GBS, territories affected by Zika virus need to plan health-care resources to manage GBS patients. To inform such planning in Martinique, we analyzed Zika virus surveillance and GBS data from Martinique in real time with a modeling framework that captured dynamics of the Zika virus epidemic, the risk of GBS in Zika virus–infected persons, and the clinical management of GBS cases. We compared our estimates with those from the 2013–2014 Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia. We were able to predict just a few weeks into the epidemic that, due to lower transmission potential and lower probability of developing GBS following infection in Martinique, the total number of GBS cases in Martinique would be substantially lower than suggested by simple extrapolations from French Polynesia. We correctly predicted that 8 intensive-care beds and 7 ventilators would be sufficient to treat GBS cases. This study showcased the contribution of modeling to inform local health-care planning during an outbreak. Timely studies that estimate the proportion of infected persons that seek care are needed to improve the predictive power of such approaches. Blood Pressure Measurement Anno 2016 The rational management of hypertension (HT) inevitably starts with accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP). The recently published Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial implemented automated office BP measurement. However, event-driven studies have overwhelmingly indicated that out-of-the-office BP monitoring is a prerequisite for risk stratification and for identifying the need of initiating or adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment. 24-Hour ambulatory BP monitoring is the preferred method of BP measurement and addresses major issues not covered by conventional or automated office BP measurement or home BP monitoring, such as reliably diagnosing nocturnal HT (the time window of the day during which BP is most predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcome), hypotension, or masked HT, a condition that affects 15% of the general populations and carries a risk equal to that of HT on both office and out-of-the-office BP measurement. Moreover, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring is cost-effective. Outcome-driven criteria support single BP thresholds that can be applied in both sexes and across the age range. In conclusion, the overall evidence now overwhelmingly shows that ambulatory BP monitoring is mandatory for the proper management of HT. Health care providers should therefore facilitate access to this technique in both primary and specialized care. ispartof: American Journal of Hypertension vol:30 issue:5 pages:453-463 ispartof: location:United States status: published Office and Home Blood Pressures as Determinants of Electrocardiographic Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Among Black Nigerians Compared With White Flemish BACKGROUND The association of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) with blood pressure (BP) in Blacks living in sub-Saharan Africa remains poorly documented. METHODS In 225 Black Nigerians and 729 White Flemish, we analyzed QRS voltages and voltage-duration products and 12 criteria diagnostic of ECG-LVH in relation to office BP (mean of 5 consecutive readings) and home BP (duplicate morning and evening readings averaged over 1 week). RESULTS In multivariable analyses, QRS voltage and voltage-duration indexes were generally higher in Blacks than Whites. By using any of 12 criteria, ECG-LVH was more prevalent among Black than White men (54.4% vs. 36.0%) with no ethnic difference among women (17.1%). Precordial voltages and voltage-duration products increased with office and home systolic BP (SBP), and increases were up to 3-fold steeper in Blacks. In Blacks vs. Whites, increases in the Sokolow-Lyon voltage associated with a 10-mm Hg higher SBP were 0.18 mV (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.26) vs. 0.06 mV (0.02-0.09) and 0.17 mV (0.07-0.28) vs. 0.11 mV (CI, 0.07-0.15) for office and home BP, respectively, with a significant ethnic gradient (P < 0.05). The risk of ECG-LVH increased more with office and home BP in Blacks than Whites. CONCLUSIONS Associations of ECG voltages and voltage-duration products and risk of ECG-LVH with BP are steeper in Black Nigerians compared with a White reference population. In resource-poor settings of sub-Saharan Africa, the ECG in combination with office and home BP is an essential instrument in risk stratification across the entire BP range.

ECG Voltage in Relation to Peripheral and Central Ambulatory Blood Pressure BACKGROUND The heart ejects in the central elastic arteries. No previous study in workers described the diurnal profile of central blood pressure (BP) or addressed the question whether electrocardiogram (ECG) indexes are more closely associated with central than peripheral BP. METHODS In 177 men (mean age, 29.1 years), we compared the associations of ECG indexes with brachial and central ambulatory BP, measured over 24 hours by the validated oscillometric Mobil-O-Graph 24h PWA monitor. RESULTS From wakefulness to sleep, as documented by diaries, systolic/diastolic BP decreased by 11.7/13.1 mm Hg peripherally and 9.3/13.6 mm Hg centrally, whereas central pulse pressure (PP) increased by 4.3 mm Hg (P < 0.0001). Over 24 hours and the awake and asleep periods, the peripheral-minus-central differences in systolic/diastolic BPs averaged 11.8/-1.6, 12.7/-1.8, and 10.3/-1.2 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.0001). Cornell voltage and index averaged 1.18 mV and 114.8 mV.ms. Per 1-SD increment in systolic/diastolic BP, the Cornell voltages were 0.104/0.086 mV and 0.082/0.105 mV higher in relation to brachial 24-hour and asleep BP and 0.088/0.90 mV and 0.087/0.107 mV higher in relation to central BP. The corresponding estimates for the Cornell indexes were 9.6/8.6 and 8.2/10.5 mV.ms peripherally and 8.6/8.9 and 8.8/10.7 mV.ms centrally. The regression slopes (P = 0.067) and correlation coefficients (P = 0.088) were similar for brachial and central BP. Associations of ECG measurements with awake BP and PP were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Peripheral and central BPs run in parallel throughout the day and are similarly associated with the Cornell voltage and index.

Structural insight to mutation effects uncover a common allosteric site in class C GPCRs Abstract Motivation: Class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate important physiological functions and allosteric modulators binding to the transmembrane domain constitute an attractive and, due to a lack of structural insight, a virtually unexplored potential for therapeutics and the food industry. Combining pharmacological site-directed mutagenesis data with the recent class C GPCR experimental structures will provide a foundation for rational design of new therapeutics. Results: We uncover one common site for both positive and negative modulators with different amino acid layouts that can be utilized to obtain selectivity. Additionally, we show a large potential for structure-based modulator design, especially for four orphan receptors with high similarity to the crystal structures.

PlayMolecule BindScope: large scale CNN-based virtual screening on the web Summary Virtual screening pipelines are one of the most popular used tools in structure-based drug discovery, since they can can reduce both time and cost associated with experimental assays. Recent advances in deep learning methodologies have shown that these outperform classical scoring functions at discriminating binder protein-ligand complexes. Here, we present BindScope, a web application for large-scale active-inactive classification of compounds based on deep convolutional neural networks. Performance is on a pair with current state-of-the-art pipelines. Users can screen on the order of hundreds of compounds at once and interactively visualize the results. Availability and implementation BindScope is available as part of the PlayMolecule.org web application suite. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. Accurate peptide fragmentation predictions allow data driven approaches to replace and improve upon proteomics search engine scoring functions Abstract                                                  Motivation The use of post-processing tools to maximize the information gained from a proteomics search engine is widely accepted and used by the community, with the most notable example being Percolator—a semi-supervised machine learning model which learns a new scoring function for a given dataset. The usage of such tools is however bound to the search engine’s scoring scheme, which doesn’t always make full use of the intensity information present in a spectrum. We aim to show how this tool can be applied in such a way that maximizes the use of spectrum intensity information by leveraging another machine learning-based tool, MS2PIP. MS2PIP predicts fragment ion peak intensities. Results We show how comparing predicted intensities to annotated experimental spectra by calculating direct similarity metrics provides enough information for a tool such as Percolator to accurately separate two classes of peptide-to-spectrum matches. This approach allows using more information out of the data (compared with simpler intensity based metrics, like peak counting or explained intensities summing) while maintaining control of statistics such as the false discovery rate.

A comprehensive analysis of rare genetic variation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the UK Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons. About 25 genes have been verified as relevant to the disease process, with rare and common variation implicated. We used next generation sequencing and repeat sizing to comprehensively assay genetic variation in a panel of known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes in 1126 patient samples and 613 controls. About 10% of patients were predicted to carry a pathological expansion of the C9orf72 gene. We found an increased burden of rare variants in patients within the untranslated regions of known disease-causing genes, driven by SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, OPTN and UBQLN2. We found 11 patients (1%) carried more than one pathogenic variant (P = 0.001) consistent with an oligogenic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These findings show that the genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is complex and that variation in the regulatory regions of associated genes may be important in disease pathogenesis. Multiple sclerosis risk variants alter expression of co-stimulatory genes in B cells Abstract The increasing evidence supporting a role for B cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis prompted us to investigate the influence of known susceptibility variants on the surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules in these cells. Using flow cytometry we measured surface expression of CD40 and CD86 in B cells from 68 patients and 162 healthy controls that were genotyped for the multiple sclerosis associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4810485, which maps within the CD40 gene, and rs9282641, which maps within the CD86 gene. We found that carrying the risk allele rs4810485*T lowered the cell-surface expression of CD40 in all tested B cell subtypes (in total B cells P ≤ 5.10 × 10−5 in patients and ≤4.09 × 10−6 in controls), while carrying the risk allele rs9282641*G increased the expression of CD86, with this effect primarily seen in the naïve B cell subset (P = 0.048 in patients and 5.38 × 10−5 in controls). In concordance with these results, analysis of RNA expression demonstrated that the risk allele rs4810485*T resulted in lower total CD40 expression (P = 0.057) but with an increased proportion of alternative splice-forms leading to decoy receptors (P = 4.00 × 10−7). Finally, we also observed that the risk allele rs4810485*T was associated with decreased levels of interleukin-10 (P = 0.020), which is considered to have an immunoregulatory function downstream of CD40. Given the importance of these co-stimulatory molecules in determining the immune reaction that appears in response to antigen our data suggest that B cells might have an important antigen presentation and immunoregulatory role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Neuroinflammation and Tau Interact with Amyloid in Predicting Sleep Problems in Aging Independently of Atrophy Sleep problems relate to brain changes in aging and disease, but the mechanisms are unknown. Studies suggest a relationship between β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and sleep, which is likely augmented by interactions with multiple variables. Here, we tested how different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for brain pathophysiology, brain atrophy, memory function, and depressive symptoms predicted self-reported sleep patterns in 91 cognitively healthy older adults over a 3-year period. The results showed that CSF levels of total- and phosphorylated (P) tau, and YKL-40-a marker of neuroinflammation/astroglial activation-predicted poor sleep in Aβ positive older adults. Interestingly, although brain atrophy was strongly predictive of poor sleep, the relationships between CSF biomarkers and sleep were completely independent of atrophy. A joint analysis showed that unique variance in sleep was explained by P-tau and the P-tau × Aβ interaction, memory function, depressive symptoms, and brain atrophy. The results demonstrate that sleep relates to a range of different pathophysiological processes, underscoring the importance of understanding its impact on neurocognitive changes in aging and people with increased risk of Alzheimer\\'s disease. Reduced Efficacy of Praziquantel AgainstSchistosoma mansoniIs Associated With Multiple Rounds of Mass Drug Administration Abstract Background.\\u2003Mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel is the cornerstone of schistosomiasis control in sub-Saharan Africa. The effectiveness of this strategy is dependent on the continued high efficacy of praziquantel; however, drug efficacy is rarely monitored using appropriate statistical approaches that can detect early signs of wane. Methods.\\u2003We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study, examining children infected with Schistosoma mansoni from 6 schools in Uganda that had previously received between 1 and 9 rounds of MDA with praziquantel. We collected up to 12 S. mansoni egg counts from 414 children aged 6–12 years before and 25–27 days after treatment with praziquantel. We estimated individual patient egg reduction rates (ERRs) using a statistical model to explore the influence of covariates, including the number of prior MDA rounds. Results.\\u2003The average ERR among children within schools that had received 8 or 9 previous rounds of MDA (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 88.23%–93.64%) was statistically significantly lower than the average in schools that had received 5 rounds (95% BCI, 96.13%–99.08%) or 1 round (95% BCI, 95.51%–98.96%) of MDA. We estimate that 5.11%, 4.55%, and 16.42% of children from schools that had received 1, 5, and 8–9 rounds of MDA, respectively, had ERRs below the 90% threshold of optimal praziquantel efficacy set by the World Health Organization. Conclusions.\\u2003The reduced efficacy of praziquantel in schools with a higher exposure to MDA may pose a threat to the effectiveness of schistosomiasis control programs. We call for the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs used in MDA to be closely monitored. Theoretical foundations of emergent constraints: relationships between climate sensitivity and global temperature variability in conceptual models There is as yet no theoretical framework to guide the search for emergent constraints. As a result, there are significant risks that indiscriminate data-mining of the multidimensional outputs from GCMs could lead to spurious correlations and less than robust constraints on future changes. To mitigate against this risk, Cox et al (hereafter CHW18) proposed a theory-motivated emergent constraint, using the one-box Hasselmann model to identify a linear relationship between ECS and a metric of global temperature variability involving both temperature standard deviation and autocorrelation (_$\\\\Psi_$). A number of doubts have been raised about this approach, some concerning the theory and the application of the one-box model to understand relationships in complex GCMs which are known to have more than the single characteristic timescale. We illustrate theory driven testing of emergent constraints using this as an example, namely we demonstrate that the linear _$\\\\Psi_$-ECS proportionality is not an artifact of the one-box model and rigorously features to a good approximation in more realistic, yet still analytically soluble conceptual models, namely the two-box and diffusion models. Each of the conceptual models predict different power spectra with only the diffusion model\\'s pink spectrum being compatible with observations and the complex CMIP5 GCMs. We also show that the theoretically predicted _$\\\\Psi_$-ECS relationship exists in the \\\\texttt{piControl} as well as \\\\texttt{historical} CMIP5 experiments and that the differing gradients of the proportionality are inversely related to the effective forcing in that experiment. Cathepsin A mediates susceptibility to atrial tachyarrhythmia and impairment of atrial emptying function in Zucker diabetic fatty rats Aims Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke. The serine protease cathepsin A (CatA) is up-regulated in diabetes and plays an important role in the degradation of extracellular peptides. This study sought to delineate the role of CatA for the development of atrial remodelling under diabetic conditions. Methods and results Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF) were treated with vehicle ( n = 20) or CatA-inhibitor (SAR; 50 mg/kg; n = 20), and compared with age-matched non-diabetic littermates (Ctr, n = 20). Left-atrial (LA) emptying function [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and atrial electrophysiological parameters were measured before sacrifice for histological and biochemical analysis. The impact of enhanced cardiac CatA expression on atrial remodelling was determined using CatA-transgenic mice. At the age of 9.5 months, atrial tissues of ZDF rats showed increased CatA gene expression and CatA-activity, along with increased AF-susceptibility and impaired LA-emptying function. CatA-inhibition reduced CatA-activity in ZDF comparable to Ctr values and decreased LA-fibrosis formation and connexin 43 lateralization. This was associated with shorter median duration of LA-tachyarrhythmia (12.0 ± 1.7 vs. 1.2 ± 0.47 s, P < 0.01) induced by burst pacing and diminished regions of slow conduction. Cardiac MRI revealed better LA-emptying function parameters (active per cent emptying: 29 ± 1 vs. 23 ± 2%, P < 0.01) after CatA-inhibition. CatA-inhibition reduced LA bradykinin-degrading activity in ZDF. Transgenic mice overexpressing CatA demonstrated enhanced atrial fibrosis formation and increased AF-susceptibility. Conclusion T2D leads to arrhythmogenic atrial remodelling in ZDF rats. CatA-inhibition reduces LA bradykinin-degrading activity in ZDF and suppresses the development of atrial structural changes and AF-promotion, implicating CatA as an important mediator for AF-substrate in T2D. Left atrial geometry and outcome of atrial fibrillation ablation: results from the multicentre LAGO-AF study Aims: Left atrial (LA) remodelling is a key determinant of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation outcome. Optimal methods to assess this process are scarce. LA sphericity is a shape-based parameter shown to be independently associated to procedural success. In a multicentre study, we aimed to test the feasibility of assessing LA sphericity and evaluate its capability to predict procedural outcomes. Methods and results: This study included consecutive patients undergoing first AF ablation during 2013. A 3D model of the LA chamber, excluding pulmonary veins and LA appendage, was used to quantify LA volume (LAV) and LA sphericity (≥82.1% was considered spherical LA). In total, 243 patients were included across 9 centres (71% men, aged 56\\u2009±\\u200910\\u2009years, 44% with hypertension and 76% CHA2DS2-VASc\\u2009≤\\u20091). Most patients had paroxysmal AF (66%) and underwent radiofrequency ablation (60%). Mean LA diameter (LAD), LAV, and LA sphericity were 42\\u2009±\\u20096\\u2009mm, 100\\u2009±\\u200933\\u2009mL, and 82.6\\u2009±\\u20093.5%, respectively. Adjusted Cox models identified paroxysmal AF [hazard ratio (HR 0.54, P\\u2009=\\u20090.032)] and LA sphericity (HR 1.87, P\\u2009=\\u20090.035) as independent predictors for AF recurrence. A combined clinical-imaging score [Left Atrial Geometry and Outcome (LAGO)] including five items (AF phenotype, structural heart disease, CHA2DS2-VASc\\u2009≤\\u20091, LAD, and LA sphericity) classified patients at low (≤2 points) and high risk (≥3 points) of procedural failure (35% vs. 82% recurrence at 3-year follow-up, respectively; HR 3.10, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Conclusion: In this multicentre, real-life cohort, LA sphericity and AF phenotype were the strongest predictors of AF ablation outcome after adjustment for covariates. The LAGO score was easy to implement, identified high risk of procedural failure, and could help select optimal candidates.

Hypercoagulability causes atrial fibrosis and promotes atrial fibrillation Aims Atrial fibrillation (AF) produces a hypercoagulable state. Stimulation of protease-activated receptors by coagulation factors provokes pro-fibrotic, pro-hypertrophic, and pro-inflammatory responses in a variety of tissues. We studied the effects of thrombin on atrial fibroblasts and tested the hypothesis that hypercoagulability contributes to the development of a substrate for AF. Methods and results In isolated rat atrial fibroblasts, thrombin enhanced the phosphorylation of the pro-fibrotic signalling molecules Akt and Erk and increased the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (2.7-fold) and the pro-inflammatory factor monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (6.1-fold). Thrombin also increased the incorporation of H-3-proline, suggesting enhanced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts (2.5-fold). All effects could be attenuated by the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. In transgenic mice with a pro-coagulant phenotype (TMpro/pro), the inducibility of AF episodes lasting >1 s was higher (7 out of 12 vs. 1 out of 10 in wild type) and duration of AF episodes was longer compared with wild type mice (maximum episode duration 42.8 +/- 68.4 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.39 s). In six goats with persistent AF treated with nadroparin, targeting Factor Xa-mediated thrombin generation, the complexity of the AF substrate was less pronounced than in control animals (LA maximal activation time differences 23.3 +/- 3.1 ms in control vs. 15.7 +/- 2.1 ms in nadroparin, P <0.05). In the treated animals, AF-induced a-smooth muscle actin expression was lower and endomysial fibrosis was less pronounced. Conclusion The hypercoagulable state during AF causes pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory responses in adult atrial fibroblasts. Hypercoagulability promotes the development of a substrate for AF in transgenic mice and in goats with persistent AF. In AF goats, nadroparin attenuates atrial fibrosis and the complexity of the AF substrate. Inhibition of coagulation may not only prevent strokes but also inhibit the development of a substrate for AF. Catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation Catheter ablation is increasingly offered to patients who suffer from symptoms due to atrial fibrillation (AF), based on a growing body of evidence illustrating its efficacy compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Approximately one-third of AF ablation procedures are currently performed in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF. Here, we review the available information to guide catheter ablation in these more chronic forms of AF. We identify the following principles: Our clinical ability to discriminate paroxysmal and persistent AF is limited. Pulmonary vein isolation is a reasonable and effective first approach for catheter ablation of persistent AF. Other ablation strategies are being developed and need to be properly evaluated in controlled, multicentre trials. Treatment of concomitant conditions promoting recurrent AF by life style interventions and medical therapy should be a routine adjunct to catheter ablation of persistent AF. Early rhythm control therapy has a biological rationale and trials evaluating its value are underway. There is a clear need to generate more evidence for the best approach to ablation of persistent AF beyond pulmonary vein isolation in the form of adequately powered controlled multi-centre trials. Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the Munich Octoberfest: results from the Munich Beer Related Electrocardiogram Workup Study (MunichBREW) Abstract Aims Alcohol is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias. Retrospective analyses suggest supraventricular arrhythmias consecutive to acute alcohol consumption, but prospective data are limited. We intended to prospectively associate acute alcohol consumption with cardiac arrhythmias. Methods and results At the 2015 Munich Octoberfest, we enrolled 3028 voluntary participants who received a smartphone-based ECG and breath alcohol concentration (BAC) measurements. ECGs were analysed for cardiac arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, premature atrial/ventricular complexes, atrial fibrillation/flutter) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. By multivariable adjusted logistic regression we associated BACs with cardiac arrhythmias. Similarly, we analysed 4131 participants of the community-based KORA S4 Study (Co-operative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) and associated cardiac arrhythmias with chronic alcohol consumption. In our acute alcohol cohort (mean age 34.4\\u2009±\\u200913.3 years, 29% women), mean BAC was 0.85\\u2009±\\u20090.54\\u2009g/kg. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in 30.5% (sinus tachycardia 25.9%; other arrhythmia subtypes 5.4%). Breath alcohol concentration was significantly associated with cardiac arrhythmias overall (odds ratio (OR) per 1-unit change 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50–2.05; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and sinus tachycardia in particular (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.66–2.31; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia measuring autonomic tone was significantly reduced under the influence of alcohol. In KORA S4, chronic alcohol consumption was associated with sinus tachycardia (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.06; P\\u2009=\\u20090.006). Conclusions Acute alcohol consumption is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sinus tachycardia in particular. This partly reflects autonomic imbalance as assessed by significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Such imbalance might lead to sympathetically triggered atrial fibrillation resembling the holiday heart syndrome. ClinicalTrials.org accession number NCT02550340. Apixaban in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation Aims: It is recommended to perform atrial fibrillation ablation with continuous anticoagulation. Continuous apixaban has not been tested. Methods and results: We compared continuous apixaban (5\\u2009mg b.i.d.) to vitamin K antagonists (VKA, international normalized ratio 2-3) in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke a prospective, open, multi-centre study with blinded outcome assessment. Primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2-5). A high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study quantified acute brain lesions. Cognitive function was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at end of follow-up. Overall, 674 patients (median age 64\\u2009years, 33% female, 42% non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 49 sites) were randomized; 633 received study drug and underwent ablation; 335 undertook MRI (25 sites, 323 analysable scans). The primary outcome was observed in 22/318 patients randomized to apixaban, and in 23/315 randomized to VKA {difference -0.38% [90% confidence interval (CI) -4.0%, 3.3%], non-inferiority P\\u2009=\\u20090.0002 at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075}, including 2 (0.3%) deaths, 2 (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions were found in a similar number of patients in each arm [apixaban 44/162 (27.2%); VKA 40/161 (24.8%); P\\u2009=\\u20090.64]. Cognitive function increased at the end of follow-up (median 1 MoCA unit; P\\u2009=\\u20090.005) without differences between study groups. Conclusions: Continuous apixaban is safe and effective in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation at risk of stroke with respect to bleeding, stroke, and cognitive function. Further research is needed to reduce ablation-related acute brain lesions. Data-driven discovery and validation of circulating blood-based biomarkers associated with prevalent atrial fibrillation Abstract Aims Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health concern. Blood biomarkers associated with AF could simplify patient selection for screening and further inform ongoing research towards stratified prevention and treatment of AF. Methods and results Forty common cardiovascular biomarkers were quantified in 638 consecutive patients referred to hospital [mean\\u2009±\\u2009standard deviation age 70\\u2009±\\u200912\\u2009years, 398 (62%) male, 294 (46%) with AF] with known AF or ≥2 CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors. Paroxysmal or silent AF was ruled out by 7-day ECG monitoring. Logistic regression with forward selection and machine learning algorithms were used to determine clinical risk factors, imaging parameters, and biomarkers associated with AF. Atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with age [bootstrapped odds ratio (OR) per year\\u2009=\\u20091.060, 95% confidence interval (1.04–1.10); P\\u2009=\\u20090.001], male sex [OR\\u2009=\\u20092.022 (1.28–3.56); P\\u2009=\\u20090.008], body mass index [BMI, OR per unit\\u2009=\\u20091.060 (1.02–1.12); P\\u2009=\\u20090.003], elevated brain natriuretic peptide [BNP, OR per fold change\\u2009=\\u20091.293 (1.11–1.63); P\\u2009=\\u20090.002], elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23, OR\\u2009=\\u20091.667 (1.36–2.34); P\\u2009=\\u20090.001], and reduced TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand-receptor 2 [TRAIL-R2, OR\\u2009=\\u20090.242 (0.14–0.32); P\\u2009=\\u20090.001], but not other biomarkers. Biomarkers improved the prediction of AF compared with clinical risk factors alone (net reclassification improvement\\u2009=\\u20090.178; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Both logistic regression and machine learning predicted AF well during validation [area under the receiver-operator curve\\u2009=\\u20090.684 (0.62–0.75) and 0.697 (0.63–0.76), respectively]. Conclusion Three simple clinical risk factors (age, sex, and BMI) and two biomarkers (elevated BNP and elevated FGF-23) identify patients with AF. Further research is warranted to elucidate FGF-23 dependent mechanisms of AF. Cabins, castles, and constant hearts: rhythm control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation Abstract Recent innovations have the potential to improve rhythm control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Controlled trials provide new evidence on the effectiveness and safety of rhythm control therapy, particularly in patients with AF and heart failure. This review summarizes evidence supporting the use of rhythm control therapy in patients with AF for different outcomes, discusses implications for indications, and highlights remaining clinical gaps in evidence. Rhythm control therapy improves symptoms and quality of life in patients with symptomatic AF and can be safely delivered in elderly patients with comorbidities (mean age 70\\u2009years, 3–7% complications at 1\\u2009year). Atrial fibrillation ablation maintains sinus rhythm more effectively than antiarrhythmic drug therapy, but recurrent AF remains common, highlighting the need for better patient selection (precision medicine). Antiarrhythmic drugs remain effective after AF ablation, underpinning the synergistic mechanisms of action of AF ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs. Atrial fibrillation ablation appears to improve left ventricular function in a subset of patients with AF and heart failure. Data on the prognostic effect of rhythm control therapy are heterogeneous without a clear signal for either benefit or harm. Rhythm control therapy has acceptable safety and improves quality of life in patients with symptomatic AF, including in elderly populations with stroke risk factors. There is a clinical need to better stratify patients for rhythm control therapy. Further studies are needed to determine whether rhythm control therapy, and particularly AF ablation, improves left ventricular function and reduces AF-related complications. Emerging risk factors and the dose–response relationship between physical activity and lone atrial fibrillation: a prospective case–control study Abstract Aims The role of high-intensity exercise and other emerging risk factors in lone atrial fibrillation (Ln-AF) epidemiology is still under debate. The aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of each of the emerging risk factors and the impact of physical activity dose in patients with Ln-AF. Methods and results Patients with Ln-AF and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in a 2:1 prospective case–control study. We obtained clinical and anthropometric data transthoracic echocardiography, lifetime physical activity questionnaire, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Berlin questionnaire score, and, in patients at high risk for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome, a polysomnography. A total of 115 cases and 57 controls were enrolled. Conditional logistic regression analysis associated height [odds ratio (OR) 1.06 [1.01–1.11]], waist circumference (OR 1.06 [1.02–1.11]), OSA (OR 5.04 [1.44–17.45]), and 2000 or more hours of cumulative high-intensity endurance training to a higher AF risk. Our data indicated a U-shaped association between the extent of high-intensity training and AF risk. The risk of AF increased with an accumulated lifetime endurance sport activity ≥2000 h compared with sedentary individuals (OR 3.88 [1.55–9.73]). Nevertheless, a history of <2000 h of high-intensity training protected against AF when compared with sedentary individuals (OR 0.38 [0.12–0.98]). Conclusion A history of ≥2000 h of vigorous endurance training, tall stature, abdominal obesity, and OSA are frequently encountered as risk factors in patients with Ln-AF. Fewer than 2000 total hours of high-intensity endurance training associates with reduced Ln-AF risk. How disruption of endo-epicardial electrical connections enhances endo-epicardial conduction during atrial fibrillation Aims Loss of side-to-side electrical connections between atrial muscle bundles is thought to underlie conduction disturbances predisposing to atrial fibrillation (AF). Putatively, disruption of electrical connections occurs not only within the epicardial layer but also between the epicardial layer and the endocardial bundle network, thus impeding transmural conductions (‘breakthroughs’). However, both clinical and experimental studies have shown an enhancement of breakthroughs during later stages of AF. We tested the hypothesis that endo-epicardial uncoupling enhances endo-epicardial electrical dyssynchrony, breakthrough rate (BTR), and AF stability. Methods and results In a novel dual-layer computer model of the human atria, 100% connectivity between the two layers served as healthy control. Atrial structural remodelling was simulated by reducing the number of connections between the layers from 96 to 6 randomly chosen locations. With progressive elimination of connections, AF stability increased. Reduction in the number of connections from 96 to 24 resulted in an increase in endo-epicardial dyssynchrony from 6.6 ± 1.9 to 24.6 ± 1.3%, with a concomitant increase in BTR. A further reduction to 12 and 6 resulted in more pronounced endo-epicardial dyssynchrony of 34.4 ± 1.15 and 40.2 ± 0.52% but with BTR reduction. This biphasic relationship between endo-epicardial coupling and BTR was found independently from whether AF was maintained by re-entry or by ectopic focal discharges. Conclusion Loss of endo-epicardial coupling increases AF stability. There is a biphasic relation between endo-epicardial coupling and BTR. While at high degrees of endo-epicardial connectivity, the BTR is limited by the endo-epicardial synchronicity, at low degrees of connectivity, it is limited by the number of endo-epicardial connections. Left atrial fibrosis quantification by late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance: a new method to standardize the thresholds for reproducibility Aims Identification of left atrial (LA) fibrosis through late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) remains controversial due to the heterogeneity and lack of reproducibility of proposed methods. Our aim is to describe a normalized, reproducible, standardized method to evaluate LA fibrosis through LGE-CMR. Methods and results Electrocardiogram- and respiratory-gated 3-Tesla LGE-CMR was performed in 10 healthy young volunteers and 30 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF): 10 with paroxysmal AF, 10 with persistent AF, and 10 with a previous AF ablation procedure. Local image intensity ratio (IIR) of the LA was calculated as the absolute pixel intensity to mean blood pool intensity ratio. The healthy atrial tissue threshold was defined in young healthy volunteers (upper limit of normality set at IIR tissue mean plus 2 SDs). Dense atrial scarring was characterized in patients with previous radiofrequency-induced scarring (post-AF ablation patients). Validation groups consisted of patients with paroxysmal and persistent AFs. The upper limit of normal IIR was 1.20; IIR values higher than 1.32 (60% of mean maximum pixel intensity in post-ablation patients) were considered dense scar. Image intensity ratio values between 1.2 and 1.32 identified interstitial fibrosis. Patients with paroxysmal and persistent AFs had less atrial fibrotic tissue compared with post-ablation patients. Endocardial bipolar voltage was correlated to IIR values. Conclusions An IIR of 1.2 identifies the upper limit of normality in healthy young individuals. An IIR of >1.32 defines dense atrial fibrosis in post-ablation patients. Our results provide a consistent, comparable, and normalized tool to assess atrial arrhythmogenic substrate. The electrocardiogram as a predictor of successful pharmacological cardioversion and progression of atrial fibrillation Aims Non-invasive characterization of atrial fibrillation (AF) substrate complexity based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) may improve outcome prediction in patients receiving rhythm control therapies for AF. Multiple parameters to assess AF complexity and predict treatment outcome have been suggested. A comparative study of the predictive performance of complexity parameters on response to therapy and progression of AF in a large patient population is needed to standardize non-invasive analysis of AF. Methods and results A large variety of ECG complexity parameters were systematically compared in patients with recent onset AF undergoing pharmacological cardioversion (PCV) with flecainide. Parameters were computed on 10-s 12-lead ECGs of 221 patients before drug administration. The ability of ECG parameters to predict successful PCV and progression to persistent AF (mean follow-up 49\\u2009months) was evaluated and compared with common clinical predictors. Optimal prediction performance of successful PCV using only one ECG parameter was low, using dominant atrial frequency [lead II, receiver operating area under curve (AUC) 0.66, 95% confidence interval [0.64-0.67]], but the optimal combination of several ECG parameters strongly improved predictive performance (AUC 0.78 [0.76-0.79]). While predictive value of the optimal combination of clinical predictors was low (AUC 0.68 [0.66-0.70], using right atrial volume and weight), adding ECG parameters strongly increased performance (AUC 0.81 [0.79-0.82], P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Interestingly, higher dominant frequency and higher f-wave amplitude were associated with increased risk of progression to persistent AF during follow-up. Conclusion Assessment of AF complexity from 12-lead ECGs significantly improves prediction of successful PCV and progression to persistent AF compared with common clinical and echocardiographic predictors. European Society of Cardiology smartphone and tablet applications for patients with atrial fibrillation and their health care providers We are in the midst of a digital revolution in health care, although the application of new and useful technology in routine clinical practice is variable. The Characterizing Atrial fibrillation by Translating its Causes into Health Modifiers in the Elderly (CATCH ME) Consortium, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), has funded the creation of two applications (apps) in atrial fibrillation (AF) for use in smartphones and tablets. The patient app aims to enhance patient education, improve communication between patients and health care professionals, and encourage active patient involvement in the management of their condition. The health care professional app is designed as an interactive management tool incorporating the new ESC Practice Guidelines on AF and supported by the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), with the aim of improving best practice approaches for the care of patients with AF. Both stand-alone apps are now freely available for Android and iOS devices though the Google Play, Amazon, and Apple stores. In this article, we outline the rationale for the design and implementation of these apps. Our objective is to demonstrate the value of integrating novel digital technology into clinical practice, with the potential for patient engagement, optimization of pharmacological and interventional therapy in AF, and ultimately to improve patient outcomes.

The population with AF is expected to expand considerably and yet, apart from anticoagulation, therapies used in AF have not been shown to consistently impact on mortality or reduce adverse cardiovascular events. New approaches to AF management, including the use of novel technologies and structured, integrated care, have the potential to enhance clinical phenotyping or result in better treatment selection and stratified therapy. Here, we report the outcomes of the 6th Consensus Conference of the Atrial Fibrillation Network (AFNET) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), held at the European Society of Cardiology Heart House in Sophia Antipolis, France, 17-19 January 2017. Sixty-two global specialists in AF and 13 industry partners met to develop innovative solutions based on new approaches to screening and diagnosis, enhancing integration of AF care, developing clinical pathways for treating complex patients, improving stroke prevention strategies, and better patient selection for heart rate and rhythm control. Ultimately, these approaches can lead to better outcomes for patients with AF. Implications of bipolar voltage mapping and magnetic resonance imaging resolution in biventricular scar characterization after myocardial infarction Aims: We aimed to study the differences in biventricular scar characterization using bipolar voltage mapping compared with state-of-the-art in vivo delayed gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) imaging and ex vivo T1 mapping. Methods and results: Ten pigs with established myocardial infarction (MI) underwent in vivo scar characterization using LGE-CMR imaging and high-density voltage mapping of both ventricles using a 3.5-mm tip catheter. Ex vivo post-contrast T1 mapping provided a high-resolution reference. Voltage maps were registered onto the left and right ventricular (LV and RV) endocardium, and epicardium of CMR-based geometries to compare voltage-derived scars with surface-projected 3D scars. Voltage-derived scar tissue of the LV endocardium and the epicardium resembled surface projections of 3D in vivo and ex vivo CMR-derived scars using 1-mm of surface projection distance. The thinner wall of the RV was especially sensitive to lower resolution in vivo LGE-CMR images, in which differences between normalized low bipolar voltage areas and CMR-derived scar areas did not decrease below a median of 8.84% [interquartile range (IQR) (3.58, 12.70%)]. Overall, voltage-derived scars and surface scar projections from in vivo LGE-CMR sequences showed larger normalized scar areas than high-resolution ex vivo images [12.87% (4.59, 27.15%), 18.51% (11.25, 24.61%), and 9.30% (3.84, 19.59%), respectively], despite having used optimized surface projection distances. Importantly, 43.02% (36.54, 48.72%) of voltage-derived scar areas from the LV endocardium were classified as non-enhanced healthy myocardium using ex vivo CMR imaging. Conclusion: In vivo LGE-CMR sequences and high-density voltage mapping using a conventional linear catheter fail to provide accurate characterization of post-MI scar, limiting the specificity of voltage-based strategies and imaging-guided procedures.

Sí Electrocardiogram phenotypes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by distinct mechanisms: apico-basal repolarization gradients vs. Purkinje-myocardial coupling abnormalities Aims To identify key structural and electrophysiological features explaining distinct electrocardiogram (ECG) phenotypes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Methods and results Human heart–torso anatomical models were constructed from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images of HCM patients, representative of ECG phenotypes identified previously. High performance computing simulations using bidomain models were conducted to dissect key features explaining the ECG phenotypes with increased HCM Risk-SCD scores, namely Group 1A, characterized by normal QRS but inverted T waves laterally and coexistence of apical and septal hypertrophy; and Group 3 with marked QRS abnormalities (deep and wide S waves laterally) and septal hypertrophy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy abnormalities characterized from CMR, such as hypertrophy, tissue microstructure alterations, abnormal conduction system, and ionic remodelling, were selectively included to assess their influence on ECG morphology. Electrocardiogram abnormalities could not be explained by increased wall thickness nor by local conduction abnormalities associated with fibre disarray or fibrosis. Inverted T wave with normal QRS (Group 1A) was obtained with increased apico-basal repolarization gradient caused by ionic remodelling in septum and apex. Lateral QRS abnormalities (Group 3) were only recovered with abnormal Purkinje-myocardium coupling. Conclusion Two ECG-based HCM phenotypes are explained by distinct mechanisms: ionic remodelling and action potential prolongation in hypertrophied apical and septal areas lead to T wave inversion with normal QRS complexes, whereas abnormal Purkinje-myocardial coupling causes abnormal QRS morphology in V4–V6. These findings have potential implications for patients’ management as they point towards different arrhythmia mechanisms in different phenotypes. Three-dimensional cardiac fibre disorganization as a novel parameter for ventricular arrhythmia stratification after myocardial infarction Aims: Myocardial infarction (MI) alters cardiac fibre organization with unknown consequences on ventricular arrhythmia. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac fibres and scar reconstructions to identify the main parameters associated with ventricular arrhythmia inducibility and ventricular tachycardia (VT) features after MI. Methods and results: Twelve pigs with established MI and three controls underwent invasive electrophysiological characterization of ventricular arrhythmia inducibility and VT features. Animal-specific 3D scar and myocardial fibre distribution were obtained from ex vivo high-resolution contrast-enhanced T1 mapping and DTI sequences. Diffusion tensor imaging-derived parameters significantly different between healthy and scarring myocardium, scar volumes, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were included for arrhythmia risk stratification and correlation analyses with VT features. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was the only inducible arrhythmia in 4 out of 12 infarcted pigs and all controls. Ventricular tachycardia was also inducible in the remaining eight pigs during programmed ventricular stimulation. A DTI-based 3D fibre disorganization index (FDI) showed higher disorganization within dense scar regions of VF-only inducible pigs compared with VT inducible animals (FDI: 0.36; 0.36-0.37 vs. 0.32; 0.26-0.33, respectively, P\\u2009=\\u20090.0485). Ventricular fibrillation induction required lower programmed stimulation aggressiveness in VF-only inducible pigs than VT inducible and control animals. Neither LVEF nor scar volumes differentiated between VF and VT inducible animals. Re-entrant VT circuits were localized within areas of highly disorganized fibres. Moreover, the FDI within heterogeneous scar regions was associated with the median VT cycle length per animal (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.5320). Conclusion: The amount of scar-related cardiac fibre disorganization in DTI sequences is a promising approach for ventricular arrhythmia stratification after MI.

Sí Transdimensional inference of archeomagnetic intensity change International audience; One of the main goals of archeomagnetism is to document the secular changes of Earth\\'s magnetic field by laboratory analysis of the magnetization carried by archeological artefacts. Typical techniques for creating a time-dependent model assume a prescribed temporal discretization which, when coupled with sparse data coverage, require strong regularization generally applied over the entire time-series in order to ensure smoothness. Such techniques make it difficult to characterize uncertainty and frequency content, and robustly detect rapid changes. Key to proper modelling (and physical understanding) is a method that places a minimum level of regularization on any fit to the data. Here we apply a transdimensional Bayesian technique based on piecewise linear interpolation to sparse archeointensity data sets, in which the temporal complexity of the model is not set a priori, but is self-selected by the data. The method produces two key outputs: (i) a posterior distribution of intensity as a function of time, a useful tool for archeomagnetic dating, whose statistics are smooth but formally unregularized and (ii) by including the data ages in the model of unknown parameters, the method also produces posterior age statistics of each individual contributing datum. We test the technique using synthetic data sets and confirm agreement of our method with an integrated likelihood approach. We then apply the method to three archeomagnetic data sets all reduced to a single location: one temporally well-sampled within 700 km from Paris (here referred to as Paris700), one that is temporally sparse centred on Hawaii, and a third (from Lübeck, Germany and Paris700) that has additional ordering constraints on age from stratification. Compared with other methods, our average posterior distributions largely agree, however our credible intervals appear to much better reflect the uncertainty during periods of sparse data coverage. Because each ensemble member of the posterior distribution is piecewise linear, we only fit oscillations when required by the data. As an example, we show that an oscillatory signal, associated with temporally localized intensity maxima reported for a sparse Hawaiian data set, is not required by the data. However, we do recover the previously reported oscillation of period 260 yr for the Paris700 data set and compute the probability distribution of the period of oscillation. We further demonstrate that such an oscillation is unresolved when accounting for age uncertainty by using a fixed age and with an artificially inflated error budget on intensity. Impact of genetic risk loci for multiple sclerosis on expression of proximal genes in patients Despite advancements in genetic studies, it is difficult to understand and characterize the functional relevance of disease-associated genetic variants, especially in the context of a complex multifactorial disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a large proportion of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are context-specific, we performed RNA-Seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009145) to identify eQTLs in regions centered on 109 MS risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and 7 associated human leukocyte antigen variants. We identified 77 statistically significant eQTL associations, including pseudogenes and non-coding RNAs. Thirty-eight out of 40 testable eQTL effects were colocalized with the disease association signal. As many eQTLs are tissue specific, we aimed to detail their significance in different cell types. Approximately 70% of the eQTLs were replicated and characterized in at least one major peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived cell type. Furthermore, 40% of eQTLs were found to be more pronounced in MS patients compared with non-inflammatory neurological diseases patients. In addition, we found two single nucleotide polymorphisms to be significantly associated with the proportions of three different cell types. Mapping to enhancer histone marks and predicted transcription factor binding sites added additional functional evidence for eight eQTL regions. As an example, we found that rs71624119, shared with three other autoimmune diseases and located in a primed enhancer (H3K4me1) with potential binding for STAT transcription factors, significantly associates with ANKRD55 expression. This study provides many novel and validated targets for future functional characterization of MS and other diseases. Elongator subunit 3 (ELP3) modifies ALS through tRNA modification Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative motor neuron disorder of which the progression is influenced by several disease-modifying factors. Here, we investigated ELP3, a subunit of the elongator complex that modifies tRNA wobble uridines, as one of such ALS disease modifiers. ELP3 attenuated the axonopathy of a mutant SOD1, as well as of a mutant C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model. Furthermore, expression of ELP3 in the SOD1G93A mouse extended the survival and attenuated the denervation in this model. Depletion of ELP3 in vitro reduced the modified tRNA wobble uridine mcm5s2U and increased abundance of insoluble mutant SOD1, which was reverted by exogenous ELP3 expression. Interestingly, the expression of ELP3 in the motor cortex of ALS patients was reduced and correlated with mcm5s2U levels. Our results demonstrate that ELP3 is a modifier of ALS and suggest a link between tRNA modification and neurodegeneration. ispartof: Human Molecular Genetics vol:27 issue:7 pages:1276-1289 ispartof: location:England status: published Mutations in the stromal antigen 3 (STAG3) gene cause male infertility due to meiotic arrest Abstract                    STUDY QUESTION Are sequence variants in the stromal antigen 3 (STAG3) gene a cause for non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in infertile human males? SUMMARY ANSWER Sequence variants affecting protein function of STAG3 cause male infertility due to meiotic arrest. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY In both women and men, STAG3 encodes for a meiosis-specific protein that is crucial for the functionality of meiotic cohesin complexes. Sequence variants in STAG3 have been reported to cause meiotic arrest in male and female mice and premature ovarian failure in human females, but not in infertile human males so far. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION The full coding region of STAG3 was sequenced directly in a cohort of 28 men with NOA due to meiotic arrest. In addition, a larger group of 275 infertile men that underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) was screened for potential STAG3 sequence variants. Furthermore, meiotic spreads, immunohistochemistry, WES and population sampling probability (PSAP) have been conducted in the index case. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS This study included 28 infertile but otherwise healthy human males who underwent Sanger sequencing of the full coding region of STAG3. Additionally, WES data of 275 infertile human males with different infertility phenotypes have been screened for relevant STAG3 variants. All participants underwent karyotype analysis and azoospermia factor (AZF) screening in advance. In the index patient, segregation analysis, WES data, PSAP, lab parameters, testis histology and nuclear spreads have been added to suplort the findings. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Two compound-heterozygous variants in STAG3 (c.[1262T>G];[1312C>T], p.[(Leu421Arg)];[(Arg438Ter)]) have been found to cause male infertility due to complete bilateral meiotic arrest in an otherwise healthy human male. Compound heterozygosity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the parents and the patient’s brother. Other variants which may affect spermatogenesis have been ruled out through analysis of the patient’s WES data and application of the PSAP pipeline. As expected from Stag3 knockout-mice meiotic spreads, germ cells did not develop further than zygotene and showed drastic chromosome aberrations. No rare variants in STAG3 were found in the 275 infertile males with other phenotypes. Our results indicate that STAG3 variants that negatively affect its protein function are a rare cause of NOA (<1% of cases). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We identified only one patient with compound-heterozygous variants in STAG3 causing NOA due to meiotic arrest. Future studies should evaluate STAG3 variants in larger cohorts to support this finding. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Identification of STAG3 sequence variants in infertile human males should improve genetic counselling as well as diagnostics and treatment.

Novel genetic loci associated with long-term deterioration in blood lipid concentrations and coronary artery disease in European adults BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of loci associated with blood lipids and related cardiovascular traits, but few genetic association studies have focused on long-term changes in blood lipids. METHODS: Participants from the GLACIER Study (Nmax = 3492) were genotyped with the MetaboChip array, from which 29 387 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms; replication, fine-mapping regions and wildcard SNPs for lipid traits) were extracted for association tests with 10-year change in total cholesterol (ΔTC) and triglycerides (ΔTG). Four additional prospective cohort studies (MDC, PIVUS, ULSAM, MRC Ely; Nmax = 8263 participants) were used for replication. We conducted an in silico look-up for association with coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) Consortium (N ∼ 190 0) and functional annotation for the top ranking variants. RESULTS: In total, 956 variants were associated (P < 0.01) with either ΔTC or ΔTG in GLACIER. In GLACIER, chr19:50121999 at APOE was associated with ΔTG and multiple SNPs in the APOA1/A4/C3/A5 region at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)), whereas variants in four loci, DOCK7, BRE, SYNE1 and KCNIP1, reached study-wide significance (P < 1.7 × 10(-6)). The rs7412 variant at APOE was associated with ΔTC in GLACIER (P < 1.7 × 10(-6)). In pooled analyses of all cohorts, 139 SNPs at six and five loci were associated with ΔTC and for ΔTG, respectively (P < 10(-3)). Of these, a variant at CAPN3 (P = 1.2 × 10(-4)), multiple variants at HPR (Pmin = 1.5 × 10(-6)) and a variant at SIX5 (P = 1.9 × 10(-4)) showed evidence for association with CAD. CONCLUSIONS: We identified seven novel genomic regions associated with long-term changes in blood lipids, of which three also raise CAD risk. Evidence for Congenital Zika Virus Infection From Neutralizing Antibody Titers in Maternal Sera, Northeastern Brazil Abstract Reliable diagnosis of congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is challenging. Here, we assessed ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies in 28 mothers of children with microcephaly (cases) and 122 controls from northeastern Brazil using plaque reduction neutralization tests. ZIKV-specific antibody titers were significantly higher in cases than in controls (t test, P < .0001). We identified a putative case of congenital Zika syndrome retrospectively by unusually high ZIKV-specific antibody titers. High ZIKV-specific antibody titers in cases were unrelated to prior dengue virus infection. Our data suggest a strong immunological stimulus from prolonged placental or transplacental ZIKV shedding and potential utility of maternal antibody titers to corroborate congenital ZIKV infection. Zika Virus Seroprevalence in Urban and Rural Areas of Suriname, 2017 Abstract In 2015–2016, a Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak occurred in the Americas. In 2017, we conducted a ZIKV serosurvey in Suriname in which 770 participants were recruited from 1 urban area and 2 rural villages in the tropical rainforest. All collected samples were tested for presence of ZIKV antibodies using a ZIKV immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a virus neutralization assay. We found that 35.1% of the participants had neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV. In 1 remote village in the rainforest, 24.5% of the participants had neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV, suggesting that ZIKV was widely spread across Suriname. Implementing pharmacogenomics decision support across seven European countries: The Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics (U-PGx) project Abstract Clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx) has the potential to make pharmacotherapy safer and more effective by utilizing genetic patient data for drug dosing and selection. However, widespread adoption of PGx depends on its successful integration into routine clinical care through clinical decision support tools, which is often hampered by insufficient or fragmented infrastructures. This paper describes the setup and implementation of a unique multimodal, multilingual clinical decision support intervention consisting of digital, paper-, and mobile-based tools that are deployed across implementation sites in seven European countries participating in the Ubiquitous PGx (U-PGx) project. Fast Genome-Wide Functional Annotation through Orthology Assignment by eggNOG-Mapper Abstract Orthology assignment is ideally suited for functional inference. However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines are relatively inaccessible (e.g., new assignments only available through database updates), less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We, therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by 11%, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15%. Compared with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35%. EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally, we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan. eggNOG-mapper runs ∼15× faster than BLAST and at least 2.5× faster than InterProScan. The tool is available standalone and as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de. Transient overexpression of DNA adenine methylase enables efficient and mobile genome engineering with reduced off-target effects Homologous recombination of single-stranded oligonucleotides is a highly efficient process for introducing precise mutations into the genome of E. coli and other organisms when mismatch repair (MMR) is disabled. This can result in the rapid accumulation of off-target mutations that can mask desired phenotypes, especially when selections need to be employed following the generation of combinatorial libraries. While the use of inducible mutator phenotypes or other MMR evasion tactics have proven useful, reported methods either require non-mobile genetic modifications or costly oligonucleotides that also result in reduced efficiencies of replacement. Therefore a new system was developed, Transient Mutator Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (TM-MAGE), that solves problems encountered in other methods for oligonucleotide-mediated recombination. TM-MAGE enables nearly equivalent efficiencies of allelic replacement to the use of strains with fully disabled MMR and with an approximately 12- to 33-fold lower off-target mutation rate. Furthermore, growth temperatures are not restricted and a version of the plasmid can be readily removed by sucrose counterselection. TM-MAGE was used to combinatorially reconstruct mutations found in evolved salt-tolerant strains, enabling the identification of causative mutations and isolation of strains with up to 75% increases in growth rate and greatly reduced lag times in 0.6 M NaCl. GPCRdb: an information system for G protein-coupled receptors Recent developments in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structural biology and pharmacology have greatly enhanced our knowledge of receptor structure-function relations, and have helped improve the scientific foundation for drug design studies. The GPCR database, GPCRdb, serves a dual role in disseminating and enabling new scientific developments by providing reference data, analysis tools and interactive diagrams. This paper highlights new features in the fifth major GPCRdb release: (i) GPCR crystal structure browsing, superposition and display of ligand interactions; (ii) direct deposition by users of point mutations and their effects on ligand binding; (iii) refined snake and helix box residue diagram looks; and (iii) phylogenetic trees with receptor classification colour schemes. Under the hood, the entire GPCRdb front- and back-ends have been re-coded within one infrastructure, ensuring a smooth browsing experience and development. GPCRdb is available at http://www.gpcrdb.org/ and it\\'s open source code at https://bitbucket.org/gpcr/protwis. Single-molecule FRET reveals the pre-initiation and initiation conformations of influenza virus promoter RNA Influenza viruses have a segmented viral RNA (vRNA) genome, which is replicated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). Replication initiates on the vRNA 3΄ terminus, producing a complementary RNA (cRNA) intermediate, which serves as a template for the synthesis of new vRNA. RNAP structures show the 3΄ terminus of the vRNA template in a pre-initiation state, bound on the surface of the RNAP rather than in the active site; no information is available on 3΄ cRNA binding. Here, we have used single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to probe the viral RNA conformations that occur during RNAP binding and initial replication. We show that even in the absence of nucleotides, the RNAP-bound 3΄ termini of both vRNA and cRNA exist in two conformations, corresponding to the pre-initiation state and an initiation conformation in which the 3΄ terminus of the viral RNA is in the RNAP active site. Nucleotide addition stabilises the 3΄ vRNA in the active site and results in unwinding of the duplexed region of the promoter. Our data provide insights into the dynamic motions of RNA that occur during initial influenza replication and has implications for our understanding of the replication mechanisms of similar pathogenic viruses.\\\\ud \\\\ud proGenomes: a resource for consistent functional and taxonomic annotations of prokaryotic genomes The availability of microbial genomes has opened many new avenues of research within microbiology. This has been driven primarily by comparative genomics approaches, which rely on accurate and consistent characterization of genomic sequences. It is nevertheless difficult to obtain consistent taxonomic and integrated functional annotations for defined prokaryotic clades. Thus, we developed proGenomes, a resource that provides user-friendly access to currently 25 38 high-quality genomes whose sequences and consistent annotations can be retrieved individually or by taxonomic clade. These genomes are assigned to 5306 consistent and accurate taxonomic species clusters based on previously established methodology. proGenomes also contains functional information for almost 80 million protein-coding genes, including a comprehensive set of general annotations and more focused annotations for carbohydrate-active enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes. Additionally, broad habitat information is provided for many genomes. All genomes and associated information can be downloaded by user-selected clade or multiple habitat-specific sets of representative genomes. We expect that the availability of high-quality genomes with comprehensive functional annotations will promote advances in clinical microbial genomics, functional evolution and other subfields of microbiology. proGenomes is available at http://progenomes.embl.de. ISSN:1362-4962 ISSN:0301-5610 Ensembl 2018 Abstract The Ensembl project has been aggregating, processing, integrating and redistributing genomic datasets since the initial releases of the draft human genome, with the aim of accelerating genomics research through rapid open distribution of public data. Large amounts of raw data are thus transformed into knowledge, which is made available via a multitude of channels, in particular our browser (http://www.ensembl.org). Over time, we have expanded in multiple directions. First, our resources describe multiple fields of genomics, in particular gene annotation, comparative genomics, genetics and epigenomics. Second, we cover a growing number of genome assemblies; Ensembl Release 90 contains exactly 100. Third, our databases feed simultaneously into an array of services designed around different use cases, ranging from quick browsing to genome-wide bioinformatic analysis. We present here the latest developments of the Ensembl project, with a focus on managing an increasing number of assemblies, supporting efforts in genome interpretation and improving our browser. GPCRdb in 2018: adding GPCR structure models and ligands Abstract G protein-coupled receptors are the most abundant mediators of both human signalling processes and therapeutic effects. Herein, we report GPCRome-wide homology models of unprecedented quality, and roughly 150 0 GPCR ligands with data on biological activities and commercial availability. Based on the strategy of ‘Less model – more Xtal’, each model exploits both a main template and alternative local templates. This achieved higher similarity to new structures than any of the existing resources, and refined crystal structures with missing or distorted regions. Models are provided for inactive, intermediate and active states—except for classes C and F that so far only have inactive templates. The ligand database has separate browsers for: (i) target selection by receptor, family or class, (ii) ligand filtering based on cross-experiment activities (min, max and mean) or chemical properties, (iii) ligand source data and (iv) commercial availability. SMILES structures and activity spreadsheets can be downloaded for further processing. Furthermore, three recent landmark publications on GPCR drugs, G protein selectivity and genetic variants have been accompanied with resources that now let readers view and analyse the findings themselves in GPCRdb. Altogether, this update will enable scientific investigation for the wider GPCR community. GPCRdb is available at http://www.gpcrdb.org. Ensembl 2019 Abstract The Ensembl project (https://www.ensembl.org) makes key genomic data sets available to the entire scientific community without restrictions. Ensembl seeks to be a fundamental resource driving scientific progress by creating, maintaining and updating reference genome annotation and comparative genomics resources. This year we describe our new and expanded gene, variant and comparative annotation capabilities, which led to a 50% increase in the number of vertebrate genomes we support. We have also doubled the number of available human variants and added regulatory regions for many mouse cell types and developmental stages. Our data sets and tools are available via the Ensembl website as well as a through a RESTful webservice, Perl application programming interface and as data files for download. HOT or not: examining the basis of high-occupancy target regions Abstract High-occupancy target (HOT) regions are segments of the genome with unusually high number of transcription factor binding sites. These regions are observed in multiple species and thought to have biological importance due to high transcription factor occupancy. Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene promoters and consequently associated genes are stably expressed across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions are solely defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they are not noise free. Here, we show that HOT regions are likely to be ChIP-seq artifacts and they are similar to previously proposed ‘hyper-ChIPable’ regions. Using ChIP-seq data sets for knocked-out transcription factors, we demonstrate presence of false positive signals on HOT regions. We observe sequence characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers,\\xa0enrichment of RNA–DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA). The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be associated to these discriminatory features. Furthermore, we propose strategies to deal with such artifacts for the future ChIP-seq studies. The risk of nephrolithiasis is causally related to inactive matrix Gla protein, a marker of vitamin K status: a Mendelian randomization study in a Flemish population Background: Vitamin K (VK)-dependent γ-glutamate carboxylation and serine phosphorylation activate matrix Gla protein (MGP) to a potent locally acting inhibitor of calcification. Nephrolithiasis represents a process of unwanted calcification associated with substantial mortality and high recurrence rates. We hypothesized that the risk of nephrolithiasis increases with VK shortage, as exemplified by higher plasma levels of desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Methods: In 1748 randomly recruited Flemish individuals (51.1% women; mean age 46.8 years), we determined dp-ucMGP and the prevalence of nephrolithiasis at baseline (April 1996-February 2015) and its incidence during follow-up until March 2016. We estimated the multivariable-adjusted relative risk associated with the doubling of dp-ucMGP, using logistic or Cox regression. We did a Mendelian randomization analysis using four MGP genotypes as instrumental variables. Results: With adjustments applied for sex, age and 24-h urinary volume and calcium excretion, the odds of having prevalent nephrolithiasis [n\\u2009=\\u2009144 (8.2%)] associated with dp-ucMGP was 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.64; P\\u2009=\\u20090.022]. dp-ucMGP levels were associated (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.001) with MGP variants rs2098435, rs4236 and rs2430692. In the Mendelian analysis, the causal odds ratio was 3.82 (95% CI 1.15-12.7; P\\u2009=\\u20090.029). The incidence of nephrolithiasis over 12.0 years (median) was 37 cases (0.2%). With similar adjustments as before, the hazard ratio in relation to dp-ucMGP was 2.48 (95% CI 1.71-3.61; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Additional adjustment for a nephrolithiasis propensity score produced consistent results. Conclusion: Higher levels of inactive dp-ucMGP may be causally associated with the risk of nephrolithiasis. Whether or not VK deficiency plays a role in these observations remains to be firmly established. ispartof: Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation vol:33 issue:3 pages:514-522 ispartof: location:England status: published Glomerular function in relation to circulating adhesion molecules and inflammation markers in a general population Background. Inflammation is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and stimulates glomerular expression of vascular adhesion molecules (VCAMs). We investigated in a general population whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is associated with circulating adhesion molecules, inflammation markers or both.\\\\ud \\\\ud Methods. We measured serum levels of five adhesion molecules [VCAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin, E-selectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] and seven inflammation markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), TNF-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor] in 1338 randomly recruited people (50.8% women, mean age 51.7\\u2009years, eGFR 79.9\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2).\\\\ud \\\\ud Results. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, eGFR decreased (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.004) with higher VCAM-1 (association size expressed in mL/min/1.73 m2 for a doubling of the marker, −2.99), MCP-1 (−1.19), NGAL (−1.19), TNF receptor 1 (−2.78), TNF-α (−2.28) and IL-6 (−0.94). The odds ratios of having eGFR\\u2009<60 versus ≥60\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 (n\\u2009=\\u2009138 versus 1200) were significant (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.001) for VCAM-1 (1.77), MCP-1 (1.32), NGAL (1.26), TNF-R1 (1.49), TNF-α (1.45) and IL-6 (1.20). Compared with 24-h albuminuria, VCAM-1 increased (P\\u2009<0.0001) the area under the curve from 0.57 to 0.65, MCP-1 to 0.67 and TNF-R1 to 0.79, but TNF-R1 outperformed both adhesion molecules (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001).\\\\ud \\\\ud Conclusions. In a general population, eGFR is inversely associated with circulating adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and MCP-1 and several inflammation markers, but inflammation markers, in particular TNF-R1 and TNF-α, identify patients with eGFR\\u2009<60\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 more accurately. Desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein is a novel circulating biomarker predicting deterioration of renal function in the general population Background: Recent studies showing an inverse association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a microvascular trait, and inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) support the hypothesis that after vitamin K-dependent activation, matrix Gla protein (MGP) is renoprotective, but these were limited by their cross-sectional design. Methods: In 1009 randomly recruited Flemish (50.6% women), we assessed the association between eGFR and plasma dp-ucMGP, using multivariable-adjusted analyses. Results: From baseline to follow-up 8.9\\u2009years later (median), dp-ucMGP increased by 23.0% whereas eGFR decreased by 4.05\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In 938 participants with baseline eGFR ≥60\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of eGFR\\u2009<60\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 at follow-up was 8.0% versus 4.1% in the top versus the bottom halve of baseline dp-ucMGP. For a 5-fold higher plasma dp-ucMGP at baseline, eGFR at follow-up decreased by 3.15\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-5.05; P\\u2009=\\u20090.001]. The hazard ratio expressing the risk of progression to eGFR\\u2009<60\\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2 was 3.49 (95% CI 1.45-8.40; P\\u2009=\\u20090.005). The hazard ratio relating the presence of microalbuminuria at follow-up to baseline dp-ucMGP was 4.70 (95% CI 1.57-14.1; P\\u2009=\\u20090.006). Conclusions: In conclusion, circulating inactive dp-ucMGP, a biomarker of poor vitamin K status, predicts renal dysfunction. Possible underlying mechanisms include protection by activated MGP against calcification and inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein-signalling pathway. ispartof: Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation vol:33 issue:7 pages:1122-1128 ispartof: location:England status: published The risk of individual autoantibodies, autoantibody combinations and levels for arthritis development in clinically suspect arthralgia INTRODUCTION: Autoantibody testing is helpful to predict the risk of progression to clinical arthritis in subjects at risk. Previous longitudinal studies have mainly selected autoantibody-positive arthralgia patients and, consequently, the predictive values of autoantibodies were evaluated relative to each other. This study assessed risks for arthritis development of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP) in arthralgia patients considered at risk for RA by rheumatologists based on clinical characteristics (Clinically Suspect Arthralgia, CSA). METHODS: Baseline ACPA, RF and anti-CarP autoantibody-status of 241 patients, consecutively included in the CSA-cohort, was studied for risk of developing clinical arthritis during a median follow-up of 103 (IQR 81-114) weeks. RESULTS: Univariable associations for arthritis development were observed for ACPA, RF and anti-CarP antibodies; Hazard Ratios (95%CI) were 8.5 (4.7-15.5), 5.1 (2.8-9.3) and 3.9 (1.9-7.7) respectively. In multivariable analysis, only ACPA was independently associated (HR 5.1; 2.0-13.2). Relative to autoantibody-negative CSA-patients, ACPA-negative/RF-positive patients had HRs of 2.6 (1.04-6.6), ACPA-positive/RF-negative patients 8.0 (2.4-27.4), and ACPA-positive/RF-positive patients 10.5 (5.4-20.6). Positive predictive values (PPV) for development of clinical arthritis within two years were: 38% for ACPA-negative/RF-positive, 50% for ACPA-positive/RF-negative and 67% for ACPA-positive/RF-positive patients. Higher ACPA-levels were not significantly associated with increased progression to clinical arthritis, in contrast to higher RF-levels. Autoantibody levels were stable during follow-up. CONCLUSION: ACPA conferred the highest risk for arthritis development and had an additive value to RF. However, >30% of ACPA-positive/RF-positive CSA-patients did not develop arthritis during two-year follow-up. Thus, CSA and information on autoantibodies is insufficient to accurately identify imminent autoantibody-positive RA. Sleep deprivation and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease Study objectives To investigate the cumulative effect of five consecutive nights of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in healthy adults. Methods A randomized, cross-over study conducted at the University of Gothenburg. The participants (N = 13) were healthy adults (20-40 years of age) with a normal sleeping pattern. The participants underwent a baseline sleep period consisting of five nights with 8 hr spent in bed. A subsequent period with PSD consisted of five nights of maximum 4 hr of sleep per night. Four participants were also subjected to a prolonged period of PSD consisting of eight nights with 4 hr of sleep per night. Sleep was monitored by means of observation, actigraphy, and continuous polysomnographic recordings. CSF samples were collected by routine lumbar puncture after each period. CSF biomarkers included the 38, 40, and 42 amino acid-long Aβ isoforms, total-τ, phospho-τ, orexin, monoamine metabolites (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, homovanillinic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), neuron-derived biomarkers (neurofilament light, neuron-specific enolase, and fatty acid-binding protein), and astro- and microglia-derived biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100B, and YKL-40). Results PSD was associated with a 27 per cent increase in CSF orexin concentrations (p = 0.001). No PSD-related changes in CSF biomarkers for amyloid build-up in the brain, Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD)-type neurodegeneration, or astroglial activation were observed. PSD led to a shortening of time spent in all sleep stages except slow-wave sleep (SWS). Conclusion Five to eight consecutive nights of PSD, with preserved SWS, increased CSF orexin but had no effect on CSF biomarkers for amyloid deposition, neuronal injury, and astroglial activation. On the stability of sequences inserted into viral genomes Abstract Viruses are widely used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or natural hosts, and therefore a large number of viruses with exogenous sequences inserted into their genomes have been engineered. Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy. Phosphatidylglycerols are induced by gut dysbiosis and inflammation, and favorably modulate adipose tissue remodeling in obesity International audience; Lipidomic techniques can improve our understanding of complex lipid interactions that regulate metabolic diseases. Here, a serum phospholipidomics analysis identified associations between phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Compared with the other phospholipids, serum PGs were the most elevated in patients with low microbiota gene richness, which were normalized after a dietary intervention that restored gut microbial diversity. Serum PG levels were positively correlated with metagenomic functional capacities for bacterial LPS synthesis and host markers of low-grade inflammation; transcriptome databases identified PG synthase, the first committed enzyme in PG synthesis, as a potential mediator. Experiments in mice and cultured human-derived macrophages demonstrated that LPS induces PG release. Acute PG treatment in mice altered adipose tissue gene expression toward remodeling and inhibited ex vivo lipolysis in adipose tissue, suggesting that PGs favor lipid storage. Indeed, several PG species were associated with the severity of obesity in mice and humans. Finally, despite enrichment in PGs in bacterial membranes, experiments employing gnotobiotic mice colonized with recombinant PG overproducing Lactococcus lactis showed limited direct contribution of microbial PGs to the host. In summary, PGs are inflammation-responsive lipids indirectly regulated by the gut microbiota via endotoxins and regulate adipose tissue homeostasis in obesity. Receptor selectivity between the G proteins Gα\\n            12\\n            and Gα\\n            13\\n            is defined by a single leucine‐to‐isoleucine variation Despite recent advances in structural definition of GPCR–G protein complexes, the basis of receptor selectivity between G proteins remains unclear. The Gα12 and Gα13 subtypes together form the least studied group of heterotrimeric G proteins. G protein–coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) has been suggested to couple efficiently to Gα13 but weakly to Gα12. Using combinations of cells genome-edited to not express G proteins and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer–based sensors, we confirmed marked selectivity of GPR35 for Gα13. Incorporating Gα12/Gα13 chimeras and individual residue swap mutations into these sensors defined that selectivity between Gα13 and Gα12 was imbued largely by a single leucine-to-isoleucine variation at position G.H5.23. Indeed, leucine could not be substituted by other amino acids in Gα13 without almost complete loss of GPR35 coupling. The critical importance of leucine at G.H5.23 for GPR35–G protein interaction was further demonstrated by introduction of this leucine into Gαq, resulting in the gain of coupling to GPR35. These studies demonstrate that Gα13 is markedly the most effective G protein for interaction with GPR35 and that selection between Gα13 and Gα12 is dictated largely by a single conservative amino acid variation.—Mackenzie, A. E., Quon, T., Lin, L.-C., Hauser, A. S., Jenkins, L., Inoue, A., Tobin, A. B., Gloriam, D. E., Hudson, B. D., Milligan, G. Receptor selectivity between the G proteins Gα12 and Gα13 is defined by a single leucine-to-isoleucine variation. MiR‐9‐5p protects from kidney fibrosis by metabolic reprogramming MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and control biological processes (BPs), including fibrogenesis. Kidney fibrosis remains a clinical challenge and miRNAs may represent a valid therapeutic avenue. We show that miR‐9‐5p protected from renal fibrosis in the mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). This was reflected in reduced expression of pro‐fibrotic markers, decreased number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, and diminished tubular epithelial cell injury and transforming growth factor‐beta 1 (TGF‐β1)‐dependent de‐differentiation in human kidney proximal tubular (HKC‐8) cells. RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐Seq) studies in the UUO model revealed that treatment with miR‐9‐5p prevented the downregulation of genes related to key metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and glycolysis. Studies in human tubular epithelial cells demonstrated that miR‐9‐5p impeded TGF‐β1‐induced bioenergetics derangement. The expression of the FAO‐related axis peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC‐1α)‐peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα) was reduced by UUO, although preserved by the administration of miR‐9‐5p. We found that in mice null for the mitochondrial master regulator PGC‐1α, miR‐9‐5p was unable to promote a protective effect in the UUO model. We propose that miR‐9‐5p elicits a protective response to chronic kidney injury and renal fibrosis by inducing reprogramming of the metabolic derangement and mitochondrial dysfunction affecting tubular epithelial cells. Glucose kinetics: an update and novel insights into its regulation by glucagon and GLP-1 Purpose of review: Glucagon and GLP-1 share the same origin (i.e., proglucagon); primarily GLP-1 is generated from intestinal L-cells and glucagon from pancreatic α-cell, but intestinal glucagon and pancreatic GLP-1 secretion is likely. Glucose kinetics are tightly regulated by pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon, but other hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), also play an important role. The purpose of this review is to describe the recent findings on the mechanisms by which these two hormones regulate glucose kinetics. Recent findings: Recent findings showed new important mechanisms of action of glucagon and GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Knock out of glucagon receptors protects against hyperglycemia without causing hypoglycemia. GLP-1 not only stimulates insulin secretion, but it has also an independent effect on the liver and inhibits glucose production. Moreover, when coinfused with glucagon, GLP-1 limits the hyperglycemic effects. Both hormones have also central effects on gastric emptying (delayed), intestinal motility (reduced), and satiety (increased). Summary: The implications of these findings are very important for the management of type 2 diabetes given that GLP-1 receptor agonist are currently approved for the treatment of hyperglycemia and glucagon receptor antagonists and GLP-1/glucagon dual agonists are under development. Modelling variability in cardiac electrophysiology: a moment-matching approach International audience; The variability observed in action potential (AP) cardiomyocyte measurements is the consequence of many different sources of randomness. Often ignored, this variability may be studied to gain insight into the cell ionic properties. In this paper, we focus on the study of ionic channel conductances and we describe a methodology to estimate their probability density function (PDF) from action potential recordings. The method relies on the matching of observable statistical moments and on the maximum entropy principle. We present four case studies using synthetic and experimental AP measurements sets from human and canine cardiomyocytes. In each case, the proposed methodology is applied to infer the PDF of key conductances from the exhibited variability. The estimated PDFs are discussed and, when possible, compared to the true distributions. We conclude that it is possible to extract relevant information from the variability in AP measurements and discuss the limitations and possible implications of the proposed approach. Computational techniques for ECG analysis and interpretation in light of their contribution to medical advances Widely developed for clinical screening, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings capture the cardiac electrical activity from the body surface. ECG analysis can therefore be a crucial first step to help diagnose, understand and predict cardiovascular disorders responsible for 30% of deaths worldwide. Computational techniques, and more specifically machine learning techniques and computational modelling are powerful tools for classification, clustering and simulation, and they have recently been applied to address the analysis of medical data, especially ECG data. This review describes the computational methods in use for ECG analysis, with a focus on machine learning and 3D computer simulations, as well as their accuracy, clinical implications and contributions to medical advances. The first section focuses on heartbeat classification and the techniques developed to extract and classify abnormal from regular beats. The second section focuses on patient diagnosis from whole recordings, applied to different diseases. The third section presents real-time diagnosis and applications to wearable devices. The fourth section highlights the recent field of personalized ECG computer simulations and their interpretation. Finally, the discussion section outlines the challenges of ECG analysis and provides a critical assessment of the methods presented. The computational methods reported in this review are a strong asset for medical discoveries and their translation to the clinical world may lead to promising advances. Predicting evolutionary rescue via evolving plasticity in stochastic environments © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Phenotypic plasticity and its evolution may help evolutionary rescue in a novel and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals cryptic genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity. However, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may alter these predictions, because high plasticity may amplify phenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments, they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question here by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a model with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal autocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of long-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and compare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk. We find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces persistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This understanding of howstochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the emergence of chemical resistance in pests. Evidence for sexual conflict over major histocompatibility complex diversity in a wild songbird Sex differences in parasite load and immune responses are found across a wide range of animals, with females generally having lower parasite loads and stronger immune responses than males. Intrigued by these general patterns, we investigated if there was any sign of sex-specific selection on an essential component of adaptive immunity that is known to affect fitness, the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) genes, in a 20-year study of great reed warblers. Our analyses on fitness related to MHC-I diversity showed a highly significant interaction between MHC-I diversity and sex, where males with higher, and females with lower, MHC-I diversity were more successful in recruiting offspring. Importantly, mean MHC-I diversity did not differ between males and females, and consequently neither sex reached its MHC-I fitness optimum. Thus, there is an unresolved genetic sexual conflict over MHC-I diversity in great reed warblers. Selection from pathogens is known to maintain MHC diversity, but previous theory ignores that the immune environments are considerably different in males and females. Our results suggest that sexually antagonistic selection is an important, previously neglected, force in the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity, and have implications for evolutionary understanding of costs of immune responses and autoimmune diseases. A probabilistic framework for identifying biosignatures using Pathway Complexity One thing that discriminates living things from inanimate matter is their ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large abundance. From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells, microbial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations in biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies. This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an approach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures. However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity, that allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity which can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We hope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond earth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as observing when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be considered alive. Evolution of phenotypic plasticity in extreme environments Phenotypic plasticity, if adaptive, may allow species to counter the detrimental effects of extreme conditions, but the infrequent occurrence of extreme environments and/or their restriction to low-quality habitats within a species range means that they exert little direct selection on reaction norms. Plasticity could, therefore, be maladaptive under extreme environments, unless genetic correlations are strong between extreme and non-extreme environmental states, and the optimum phenotype changes smoothly with the environment. Empirical evidence suggests that populations and species from more variable environments show higher levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes, but genetic variance for plastic responses can also be low, and genetic variation may not be expressed for some classes of traits under extreme conditions. Much of the empirical literature on plastic responses to extremes has not yet been linked to ecologically relevant conditions, such as asymmetrical fluctuations in the case of temperature extremes. Nevertheless, evolved plastic responses are likely to be important for natural and agricultural species increasingly exposed to climate extremes, and there is an urgent need to collect empirical information and link this to model predictions. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events\\'. Modelling tropical forest responses to drought and El Niño with a stomatal optimization model based on xylem hydraulics The current generation of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lacks a mechanistic representation of vegetation responses to soil drought, impairing their ability to accurately predict Earth system responses to future climate scenarios and climatic anomalies, such as El Niño events. We propose a simple numerical approach to model plant responses to drought coupling stomatal optimality theory and plant hydraulics that can be used in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The model is validated against stand-scale forest transpiration ( E ) observations from a long-term soil drought experiment and used to predict the response of three Amazonian forest sites to climatic anomalies during the twentieth century. We show that our stomatal optimization model produces realistic stomatal responses to environmental conditions and can accurately simulate how tropical forest E responds to seasonal, and even long-term soil drought. Our model predicts a stronger cumulative effect of climatic anomalies in Amazon forest sites exposed to soil drought during El Niño years than can be captured by alternative empirical drought representation schemes. The contrasting responses between our model and empirical drought factors highlight the utility of hydraulically-based stomatal optimization models to represent vegetation responses to drought and climatic anomalies in DGVMs. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The impact of the 2015/2016 El Niño on the terrestrial tropical carbon cycle: patterns, mechanisms and implications’. Phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change: the importance of cue variation Phenotypic plasticity is a major mechanism of response to global change. However, current plastic responses will only remain adaptive under future conditions if informative environmental cues are still available. We briefly summarize current knowledge of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic underpinnings of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, before highlighting the potentially complex effects of global change on cue availability and reliability. We then illustrate some of these aspects with a case study, comparing plasticity of blue tit breeding phenology in two contrasted habitats: evergreen and deciduous forests. Using long-term datasets, we investigate the climatic factors linked to the breeding phenology of the birds and their main food source. Blue tits occupying different habitats differ extensively in the cues affecting laying date plasticity, as well as in the reliability of these cues as predictors of the putative driver of selective pressure, the date of caterpillar peak. The temporal trend for earlier laying date, detected only in the evergreen populations, is explained by increased temperature during their cue windows. Our results highlight the importance of integrating ecological mechanisms shaping variation in plasticity if we are to understand how global change will affect plasticity and its consequences for population biology. This article is part of the theme issue ‘The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change’. Origin and evolution of papillomavirus (onco)genes and genomes Papillomaviruses (PVs) are ancient viruses infecting vertebrates, from fishes to mammals. Although the genomes of PVs are small and show conserved synteny, PVs display large genotypic diversity and ample variation in the phenotypic presentation of the infection. Most PV genomes contain two small early genes E6 and E7 . In a bunch of closely related human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the E6 and E7 proteins provide the viruses with oncogenic potential. The recent discoveries of PVs without E6 and E7 in different fish species place a new root on the PV tree, and suggest that ancestral PVs consisted of the minimal PV backbone E1-E2-L2-L1 . Bayesian phylogenetic analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the PV backbone to 424 million years ago (Ma). Common ancestry tests on extant E6 and E7 genes indicate that they share a common ancestor dating back to at least 184 Ma. In AlphaPVs infecting Old World monkeys and apes, the appearance of the E5 oncogene 53–58 Ma concurred with (i) a significant increase in substitution rate, (ii) a basal radiation and (iii) key gain of functions in E6 and E7. This series of events was instrumental to construct the extant phenotype of oncogenic HPVs. Our results assemble the current knowledge on PV diversity and present an ancient evolutionary timeline punctuated by evolutionary innovations in the history of this successful viral family. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Silent cancer agents: multi-disciplinary modelling of human DNA oncoviruses’. Integrating within-species variation in thermal physiology into climate change ecology Accurately forecasting the response of global biota to warming is a fundamental challenge for ecology in the Anthropocene. Within-species variation in thermal sensitivity, caused by phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of thermal limits, is often overlooked in assessments of species responses to warming. Despite this, implicit assumptions of thermal niche conservatism or adaptation and plasticity at the species level permeate the literature with potentially important implications for predictions of warming impacts at the population level. Here we review how these attributes interact with the spatial and temporal context of ocean warming to influence the vulnerability of marine organisms. We identify a broad spectrum of thermal sensitivities among marine organisms, particularly in central and cool-edge populations of species distributions. These are characterized by generally low sensitivity in organisms with conserved thermal niches, to high sensitivity for organisms with locally adapted thermal niches. Important differences in thermal sensitivity among marine taxa suggest that warming could adversely affect benthic primary producers sooner than less vulnerable higher trophic groups. Embracing the spatial, temporal and biological context of within-species variation in thermal physiology helps explain observed impacts of ocean warming and can improve forecasts of climate change vulnerability in marine systems. This article is part of the theme issue \\'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen\\'. Impacts of extreme summers on European ecosystems: a comparative analysis of 2003, 2010 and 2018 In Europe, three widespread extreme summer drought and heat (DH) events have occurred in 2003, 2010 and 2018. These events were comparable in magnitude but varied in their geographical distribution and biomes affected. In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of the impact of the DH events on ecosystem CO2 fluxes over Europe based on an ensemble of 11 dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and the observation-based FLUXCOM product. We find that all DH events were associated with decreases in net ecosystem productivity (NEP), but the gross summer flux anomalies differ between DGVMs and FLUXCOM. At the annual scale, FLUXCOM and DGVMs indicate close to neutral or above-average land CO2 uptake in DH2003 and DH2018, due to increased productivity in spring and reduced respiration in autumn and winter compensating for less photosynthetic uptake in summer. Most DGVMs estimate lower gross primary production (GPP) sensitivity to soil moisture during extreme summers than FLUXCOM. Finally, we show that the different impacts of the DH events at continental-scale GPP are in part related to differences in vegetation composition of the regions affected and to regional compensating or offsetting effects from climate anomalies beyond the DH centres. Changes in net ecosystem exchange over Europe during the 2018 drought based on atmospheric observations The 2018 drought was one of the worst European droughts of the twenty-first century in terms of its severity, extent and duration. The effects of the drought could be seen in a reduction in harvest yields in parts of Europe, as well as an unprecedented browning of vegetation in summer. Here, we quantify the effect of the drought on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using five independent regional atmospheric inversion frameworks. Using a network of atmospheric CO2 mole fraction observations, we estimate NEE with at least monthly and 0.5° × 0.5° resolution for 2009-2018. We find that the annual NEE in 2018 was likely more positive (less CO2 uptake) in the temperate region of Europe by 0.09 ± 0.06 Pg C yr-1 (mean ± s.d.) compared to the mean of the last 10 years of -0.08 ± 0.17 Pg C yr-1, making the region close to carbon neutral in 2018. Similarly, we find a positive annual NEE anomaly for the northern region of Europe of 0.02 ± 0.02 Pg C yr-1 compared the 10-year mean of -0.04 ± 0.05 Pg C yr-1. In both regions, this was largely owing to a reduction in the summer CO2 uptake. The positive NEE anomalies coincided spatially and temporally with negative anomalies in soil water. These anomalies were exceptional for the 10-year period of our study. DeepWAS: Multivariate genotype-phenotype associations by directly integrating regulatory information using deep learning AbstractGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants associated with quantitative traits or disease. Thus, GWAS never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms, which, in turn, are typically inferred during post-hoc analyses. In parallel, a recent deep learning-based method allows for prediction of regulatory effects per variant on currently up to 1,000 cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe “DeepWAS”, a new approach that directly integrates predictions of these regulatory effects of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. As a result, single variants associated with a trait or disease are, by design, coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 40,000 regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder (MDD, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals) to each identify 43-61 regulatory SNPs, called deepSNPs, which are shown to reach at least nominal significance in large GWAS. MS- and height-specific deepSNPs resided in active chromatin and introns, whereas MDD-specific deepSNPs located mostly to intragenic regions and repressive chromatin states. We found deepSNPs to be enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and demonstrate the potential of the DeepWAS method to directly generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone. DeepWAS is an innovative GWAS approach with the power to identify individual SNPs in non-coding regions with gene regulatory capacity with a joint contribution to disease risk. DeepWAS is available at https://github.com/cellmapslab/DeepWAS. Extracellular mycobacterial DNA drives disease progression by triggering Caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis of infected macrophages ABSTRACTDeregulated inflammation seriously complicates life-threatening microbial infections, including tuberculosis (TB). Assembly of multiprotein inflammasome complexes is an important trigger of inflammation, but how this impacts TB progression remains unknown. Here, in vivo imaging in the zebrafish TB model revealed that mycobacterial expansion in TB granulomas is driven by inflammasomes and ensuing pyroptotic cell death of infected macrophages. We show that an Asc-independent pathway induces macrophage pyroptosis and impairs host resistance, in contrast to host-protective roles of Asc-dependent inflammasome activation and Il1b secretion. Using ASC-deficient murine macrophages, we demonstrate extracellular bacterial DNA to induce CASP11-dependent pyroptosis in a manner dependent on phagosome permeabilization. Finally, we propose that mycobacteria induce pyroptosis to escape cell-in-cell structures, formed within granulomas when living infected cells are engulfed by neighbor cells. This study provides new insight into the role of pyroptosis in TB pathogenesis and reveals a novel link between nucleic acid sensing and CASP11-dependent pyroptosis. Meiosis and Maternal Aging: Insights from Aneuploid Oocytes and Trisomy Births In most organisms, genome haploidization requires reciprocal DNA exchanges (crossovers) between replicated parental homologs to form bivalent chromosomes. These are resolved to their four constituent chromatids during two meiotic divisions. In female mammals, bivalents are formed during fetal life and remain intact until shortly before ovulation. Extending this period beyond ∼35 years greatly increases the risk of aneuploidy in human oocytes, resulting in a dramatic increase in infertility, miscarriage, and birth defects, most notably trisomy 21. Bivalent chromosomes are stabilized by cohesion between sister chromatids, which is mediated by the cohesin complex. In mouse oocytes, cohesin becomes depleted from chromosomes during female aging. Consistent with this, premature loss of centromeric cohesion is a major source of aneuploidy in oocytes from older women. Here, we propose a mechanistic framework to reconcile data from genetic studies on human trisomy and oocytes with recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation during meiosis in model organisms. Neuronal inhibition of the autophagy nucleation complex extends life span in post-reproductive C. elegans Autophagy is a ubiquitous catabolic process that causes cellular bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components and is generally associated with positive effects on health and longevity. Inactivation of autophagy has been linked with detrimental effects on cells and organisms. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory postulates that some fitness-promoting genes during youth are harmful during aging. On this basis, we examined genes mediating post-reproductive longevity using an RNAi screen. From this screen, we identified 30 novel regulators of post-reproductive longevity, including pha-4 Through downstream analysis of pha-4, we identified that the inactivation of genes governing the early stages of autophagy up until the stage of vesicle nucleation, such as bec-1, strongly extend both life span and health span. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the improvements in health and longevity are mediated through the neurons, resulting in reduced neurodegeneration and sarcopenia. We propose that autophagy switches from advantageous to harmful in the context of an age-associated dysfunction. Detection of long repeat expansions from PCR-free whole-genome sequence data Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step towards integrating WGS into precision medicine. We have developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3,001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2,786/2,789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples where every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich\\'s ataxia and Huntington\\'s disease and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions. The software is licensed under GPL v3.0 and the source code is freely available on GitHub. Universal trapping in a three-beam optical lattice We study electromagnetic trapping in an optical lattice formed by three equiangular in-plane beams. We demonstrate analytically that this optical lattice offers stable trapping sites for particles satisfying specific symmetries, irrespective of the exact nature of their electromagnetic response. Under small displacements, the particles are shown to be subject to equal restoring forces along all directions and the trap is isotropic. Though the intensity distribution of the trap forms a perfect hexagonal lattice, differences in phase variation along opposite directions cause the restoring force to be asymmetric for large displacements, resulting in a force landscape possessing only threefold symmetry. We then show numerically that this asymmetry affects the optical binding force between particles in adjacent trap positions and results in unequal shifts of their equilibrium positions. Universal trapping in the optical lattice combined with this asymmetric mechanical response of trapped particle pairs promises rich optomechanical effects. Particle production and equilibrium properties within a new hadron transport approach for heavy-ion collisions The microscopic description of heavy-ion reactions at low beam energies is achieved within hadronic transport approaches. In this article a new approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is introduced and applied to study the production of non-strange particles in heavy-ion reactions at _$E_{\\\\rm kin}=0.4-2A_$ GeV. First, the model is described including details about the collision criterion, the initial conditions and the resonance formation and decays. To validate the approach, equilibrium properties such as detailed balance are presented and the results are compared to experimental data for elementary cross sections. Finally results for pion and proton production in C+C and Au+Au collisions is confronted with HADES and FOPI data. Predictions for particle production in _$\\\\pi+A_$ collisions are made. Stochastic resonance for nonequilibrium systems Stochastic resonance (SR) is a prominent phenomenon in many natural and engineered noisy system, whereby the response to a periodic forcing is greatly amplified when the intensity of the noise is tuned to within a specific range of values. We propose here a general mathematical framework based on large deviation theory, and, specifically, on the theory of quasi-potentials, for describing SR in noisy N-dimensional non-equilibrium systems possessing two metastable states and undergoing a periodically modulated forcing. The drift and the volatility fields of the equations of motion can be fairly general and the competing attractors of the deterministic dynamics and the edge state living on the basin boundary can, in principle, feature chaotic dynamics. Similarly, the perturbation field of the forcing can be fairly general. Our approach is able to recover as special cases the classical results previously presented in the literature for systems obeying detailed balance and allows for expressing the parameters describing SR and the statistics of residence times in the two-state approximation in terms of the unperturbed drift field, the volatility field, and the perturbation field. We clarify which specific properties of the forcing are relevant for amplifying or suppressing SR in a system, and classify forcings according to classes of equivalence. Our results indicate a route for a detailed understanding of SR in rather general systems. Adaptive voter model on simplicial complexes Collective decision making processes lie at the heart of many social, political and economic challenges. The classical voter model is a well-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we define a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a simplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We use the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the recently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and introduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a 2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical simulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive voter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon varying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented state of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the fragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial quantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state below the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards fragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a multiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices, before the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many other dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar behaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different dimensions. Bispectral pairwise interacting source analysis for identifying systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources from electroencephalographic or magnetoencephalographic signals Brain cognitive functions arise through the coordinated activity of several brain regions, which actually form complex dynamical systems operating at multiple frequencies. These systems often consist of interacting subsystems, whose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding of the brain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique, namely the bispectral Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (biPISA), for analyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources when multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data are available. Specifically, the biPISA allows to identify one or many subsystems of cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra between EEG or MEG signals, based on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the properties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is also robust to spurious interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e. volume conduction or field spread, which always affect EEG or MEG functional connectivity estimates. This method is an extension of the Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (PISA), which was originally introduced for investigating interactions at the same frequency, to the study of cross-frequency interactions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in simulations for up to three interacting source pairs, and for real MEG recordings of spontaneous brain activity. Simulations show that the performances of biPISA in estimating the phase difference between the interacting sources are affected by the increasing level of noise rather than by the number of the interacting subsystems. The analysis of real MEG data reveals an interaction between two pairs of sources of central mu and beta rhythms, localizing in the proximity of the left and right central sulci. The physics of climate variability and climate change The climate system is a forced, dissipative, nonlinear, complex and heterogeneous system that is out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The system exhibits natural variability on many scales of motion, in time as well as space, and it is subject to various external forcings, natural as well as anthropogenic. This paper reviews the observational evidence on climate phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow, as well as presenting the key concept of a hierarchy of models as used in the climate sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on the one hand, and of nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other, are brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in helping understand and predict the system\\'s behavior. These complementary points of view permit a self-consistent handling of subgrid-scale phenomena as stochastic processes, as well as a unified handling of natural climate variability and forced climate change, along with a treatment of the crucial issues of climate sensitivity, response, and predictability. Unshielded SQUID Sensors for Ultra-Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging We have implemented a new field-tolerant low-critical-temperature superconducting quantum interference device current sensor with submicrometer Josephson junctions. The small junction area enables the fabrication of devices with lower sensor noise and higher tolerance against magnetic fields. An application benefitting from these properties is ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging (ULF MRI). In the currently ongoing BREAKBEN project, new technology is being pushed forward by combining ULF MRI with magnetoencephalography in a single instrument. We describe the sensor architecture aimed for this purpose and justify the guidelines behind the design. Experimental characterization reveals that, with the aid of reasonable amount of heating, unshielded sensor operation after high magnetic pulses at least up to 150 mT appears to be possible. Automatic Spatial Calibration of Ultra-Low-Field MRI for High-Accuracy Hybrid MEG–MRI With a hybrid magnetoencephalography (MEG)–MRI device that uses the same sensors for both modalities, the co-registration of MRI and MEG data can be replaced by an automatic calibration step. Based on the highly accurate signal model of ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI, we introduce a calibration method that eliminates the error sources of traditional co-registration. The signal model includes complex sensitivity profiles of the superconducting pickup coils. In the ULF MRI, the profiles are independent of the sample and therefore well-defined. In the most basic form, the spatial information of the profiles, captured in parallel ULF-MR acquisitions, is used to find the exact coordinate transformation required. We assessed our calibration method by simulations assuming a helmet-shaped pickup-coil-array geometry. Using a carefully constructed objective function and sufficient approximations, even with low-SNR images, sub-voxel and sub-millimeter calibration accuracy were achieved. After the calibration, distortion-free MRI and high spatial accuracy for MEG source localization can be achieved. For an accurate sensor-array geometry, the co-registration and associated errors are eliminated, and the positional error can be reduced to a negligible level. The ontogeny of tolerance curves: habitat quality vs. acclimation in a stressful environment Stressful environments affect life-history components of fitness through (i) instantaneous detrimental effects, (ii) historical (carry-over) effects and (iii) history-by-environment interactions, including acclimation effects. The relative contributions of these different responses to environmental stress are likely to change along life, but such ontogenic perspective is often overlooked in studies of tolerance curves, precluding a better understanding of the causes of costs of acclimation, and more generally of fitness in temporally fine-grained environments. We performed an experiment in the brine shrimp Artemia to disentangle these different contributions to environmental tolerance, and investigate how they unfold along life. We placed individuals from three clones of A. parthenogenetica over a range of salinities during a week, before transferring them to a (possibly) different salinity for the rest of their lives. We monitored individual survival at repeated intervals throughout life, instead of measuring survival or performance at a given point in time, as commonly done in acclimation experiments. We then designed a modified survival analysis model to estimate phase-specific hazard rates, accounting for the fact that individuals may share the same treatment for only part of their lives. Our approach allowed us to distinguish effects of salinity on (i) instantaneous mortality in each phase (habitat quality effects), (ii) mortality later in life (history effects) and (iii) their interaction. We showed clear effects of early salinity on late survival and interactions between effects of past and current environments on survival. Importantly, analysis of the ontogenetic dynamics of the tolerance curve reveals that acclimation affects different parts of the curve at different ages. Adopting a dynamical view of the ontogeny of tolerance curve should prove useful for understanding niche limits in temporally changing environments, where the full sequence of environments experienced by an individual determines its overall environmental tolerance, and how it changes throughout life. Contrasting results from GWAS and QTL mapping on wing length in great reed warblers A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic basis of adaptive traits. In migratory birds, wing morphology is such a trait. Our previous work on the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) shows that wing length is highly heritable and under sexually antagonistic selection. Moreover, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis detected a pronounced QTL for wing length on chromosome 2, suggesting that wing morphology is partly controlled by genes with large effects. Here, we re-evaluate the genetic basis of wing length in great reed warblers using a genomewide association study (GWAS) approach based on restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. We use GWAS models that account for relatedness between individuals and include covariates (sex, age and tarsus length). The resulting association landscape was flat with no peaks on chromosome 2 or elsewhere, which is in line with expectations for polygenic traits. Analysis of the distribution of p-values did not reveal biases, and the inflation factor was low. Effect sizes were however not uniformly distributed on some chromosomes, and the Z chromosome had weaker associations than autosomes. The level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population decayed to background levels within c. 1 kbp. There could be several reasons to why our QTL study and GWAS gave contrasting results including differences in how associations are modelled (cosegregation in pedigree vs. LD associations), how covariates are accounted for in the models, type of marker used (multi- vs. biallelic), difference in power or a combination of these. Our study highlights that the genetic architecture even of highly heritable traits is difficult to characterize in wild populations. Review article: emerging anti-fibrotic therapies in the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis SummaryBackground Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Fibrosis predicts worse outcomes and mortality. New treatments targeting fibrosis are being investigated to reverse disease progression. Aim To review the new pipeline therapeutic agents targeting fibrosis in NASH patients, with particular focus on clinical trials in which reversing fibrosis and portal hypertension are the primary outcomes. Methods The literature was searched in PubMed between January 2000 and January 2016 using search terms non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and NASH, with filters of ‘English language’. We focused on fibrosis improvement as the key outcome. We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov for promising agents that target fibrosis in NASH patients. Results Significant advances have been made on approaches targeting fibrosis in NASH patients. Many therapeutic agents are already in development, some of which have shown promising results in preclinical and phase I studies. Novel therapies have entered phase II and III studies targeting fibrosis reversal and/or improvement in portal hypertension. Innovative studies have also started looking into combining these agents, aiming at different mechanisms to maximise therapeutic outcomes. We found five clinical trials in phase II and one in phase III focusing on fibrosis in NASH patients as key outcomes. One of the phase II trials is using combination therapy to target fibrosis. Conclusions Ongoing research studies are already investigating new pathways aimed at reversing fibrosis in NASH patients. Novel therapeutic agents are in development and are expected to offer unique options to NASH patients with advanced fibrosis. Predictors of advanced fibrosis in non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Germany BACKGROUND Advanced fibrosis has been established as the most important predictor of overall mortality in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In contrast to cirrhosis, advanced, non-cirrhotic NAFLD is difficult to identify and data from Germany are lacking. AIM To identify clinical factors associated with advanced, non-cirrhotic fibrosis. METHODS Patients were recruited in the prospectively enrolling European NAFLD Registry. Clinical characteristics and the performance of non-invasive surrogate scores compared with vibration-controlled transient elastography are reported. RESULTS Two hundred and sixty-one patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD on liver biopsy (mean age 51\\xa0years, equal sex distribution) were included. The prevalence of stage 3 fibrosis on liver biopsy was 15.7%. These patients were significantly older (57 vs 50\\xa0years, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), had a higher body mass index (32.3 vs 30.5, P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), and more frequent arterial hypertension (78% vs 50%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.001) and type 2 diabetes (61% vs 24.1%, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). On multivariate logistic regression, diabetes (OR\\xa0=\\xa04.68, 95% CI 2.17-10.10) and hypertension (OR\\xa0=\\xa02.91, 95% CI 1.12-7.18) were independent predictors of advanced fibrosis. Comedication included metformin in 50% and insulin in 33% of patients with diabetes. Despite the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, the use of statins was low. Liver stiffness measurement identified advanced fibrosis with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.91). The performance of NAFLD fibrosis score, Fibrosis-4, and AST to platelet ratio index were lower with AUCs of 0.74, 0.71, and 0.67, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of metabolic comorbidities in a German population with non-cirrhotic biopsy-proven NAFLD is high. While the examined scores exhibit an acceptable specificity, liver stiffness measurement appeared to be superior to blood-based non-invasive surrogate scores in ruling out advanced fibrosis. Improvement of non-invasive markers of NAFLD from an individualised, web-based exercise program BACKGROUND Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of treatment in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, they requently fail related to the inability of patients to implement lasting changes. AIMS To evaluate the effects of a short, web-based, individualised exercise program on non-invasive markers of hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS Patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD underwent an 8-week, web-based, individualised exercise program that contained bidirectional feedback. RESULTS Forty-four patients entered the study and 41 completed the assigned training goal (93.2%). In the completer population, 8\\xa0weeks of individualised exercise increased the VO2peak by 12.2% compared to baseline (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). ALT and AST decreased by 14.3% (P\\xa0=\\xa0.002) and 18.2% (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) and remained at this level until follow-up 12\\xa0weeks after the intervention. Markers of inflammation including hsCRP, ferritin, and M30 decreased. In parallel, gut microbiota exhibited increased metagenomic richness (P\\xa0<\\xa0.05) and at the taxonomic levels Bacteroidetes and Euryarchaeota increased whereas Actinobacteria phylum decreased. Surrogate scores of steatosis and fibrosis including the fatty liver index (FLI), FiB-4, APRI and transient elastography showed significant reductions. In parallel, a marker of procollagen-3 turnover (PRO-C3) decreased while C4M2, reflecting type IV collagen, degradation increased suggesting beneficial hepatic fibrosis remodelling from exercise. Also, an enhancement in health-related quality of life was reported. CONCLUSION The current study underlines the plausibility and potential of an 8\\xa0week individualised web-based exercise program in NAFLD. Clinical trial number: NCT02526732. Significantly lower CYP2D6 metabolism measured as the\\n            O/N\\n            ‐desmethylvenlafaxine metabolic ratio in carriers of\\n            CYP2D6*41\\n            versus\\n            CYP2D6*9\\n            or\\n            CYP2D6*10\\n            : a study on therapeutic drug monitoring data from 1003 genotyped Scandinavian patients AIMS: CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*41 are the most frequent reduced‐function CYP2D6 alleles in Caucasians. Despite lacking in vivo evidence, they are collectively classified with an enzyme activity score of 0.5. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the functional impact of CYP2D6*9, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*41 on CYP2D6 metabolism in a large patient population. METHODS: A total of 1003 patients (mainly Caucasians) with data on CYP2D6 genotype and serum concentrations of venlafaxine and metabolites were included from a therapeutic drug monitoring service in Oslo, Norway. The O‐desmethyl‐to‐N‐desmethyl‐venlafaxine metabolic ratio (MR) was applied as CYP2D6 biomarker and compared (Mann–Whitney) between carriers of CYP2D6*9–10 (merged) and CYP2D6*41, either combined with CYP2D6*1 or non‐coding (null) alleles. MR subgroup estimates were obtained by multiple linear regression for calculations of CYP2D6*9–10 and CYP2D6*41 activity scores. RESULTS: MR was significantly lower in carriers of CYP2D6*41 than CYP2D6*9–10 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.002). The majority of CYP2D6*41/null carriers (86.7%) had MR in the observed range of CYP2D6null/null carriers compared with the minority of CYP2D6*9–10/null carriers (17.4%). CYP2D6 genotype explained 60.7% of MR variability in the multivariate analysis providing subgroup estimates of 9.54 (95% CI; 7.45–12.20), 3.55 (2.06–6.10), 1.33 (0.87–2.05) and 0.47 (0.35–0.61) in carriers of CYP2D6*1/null (n\\xa0=\\xa0269), CYP2D6*9–10/null (n\\xa0=\\xa017), CYP2D6*41/null (n\\xa0=\\xa030) and CYP2D6null/null (n\\xa0=\\xa095), respectively. Based on these estimates, the calculated activity score of CYP2D6*41 was 0.095 compared to 0.34 for CYP2D6*9–10. CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 metabolism measured as the O/N‐desmethylvenlafaxine ratio is significantly lower in Scandinavian carriers of CYP2D6*41 vs. CYP2D6*9–10. Thus, these alleles should be differentiated when classifying CYP2D6 phenotype from genotype. Effect of Polymorphisms on the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of Sertraline in Healthy Volunteers Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor widely metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Besides, it is a P‐glycoprotein substrate. Moreover, serotonin transporters and serotonin receptors are involved in its efficacy and safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes, transporters and receptors on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of sertraline in healthy volunteers. Forty‐six healthy volunteers (24 men and 22 women) receiving a 100‐mg single oral dose of sertraline were genotyped for 17 genetic variants of CYP enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), ATP‐binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4), 5‐hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) and 5‐hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (HTR2C) genes. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were similar in men and women. Polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 genes influenced sertraline pharmacokinetics, with a greater effect of CYP2C19. Individuals carrying defective alleles for CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 showed higher area under the curve (AUC) and half‐life (T1/2). Moreover, CYP2C19*17 was related to a decreased AUC and T1/2. No significant effect was found for polymorphisms in CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and ABCB1 on sertraline pharmacokinetics. Sertraline had a small heart rate‐lowering effect, directly related to maximum concentration (Cmax) and the presence of ABCB1 minor alleles. Sertraline had no significant effect on blood pressure and QTc. There was a tendency to present more adverse drug reactions in women and individuals with higher AUC of sertraline, such as CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2B6 G516T T/T individuals. Effect of ABCB1 C3435T Polymorphism on Pharmacokinetics of Antipsychotics and Antidepressants P‐glycoprotein, encoded by ABCB1, is an ATP‐dependent drug efflux pump which exports substances outside the cell. Some studies described connections between C3435T polymorphism T allele and lower P‐glycoprotein expression; therefore, homozygous T/T could show higher plasma levels. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of C3435T on pharmacokinetics of 4 antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and aripiprazole) and 4 antidepressants (trazodone, sertraline, agomelatine and citalopram). The study included 473 healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of one of these drugs, genotyped by real‐time PCR. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust the effect of sex and genotype of the main cytochrome P450 enzymes. C3435T polymorphism had an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics, as T/T individuals showed lower clearance and volume of distribution. T/T individuals showed lower T1/2 of 9‐OH‐risperidone, but this difference disappeared after multivariate correction. T/T homozygous individuals showed lower dehydro‐aripiprazole and trazodone area under the concentration‐time curve, along with lower half‐life and higher clearance of trazodone. C/T genotype was associated to higher citalopram maximum concentration. C3435T had no effect on quetiapine, sertraline or agomelatine pharmacokinetics. C3435T can affect the elimination of some drugs in different ways. Regarding risperidone, trazodone and dehydro‐aripiprazole, we observed enhanced elimination while it was reduced in olanzapine and citalopram. However, in quetiapine, aripiprazole, sertraline and agomelatine, no changes were detected. These results suggest that P‐glycoprotein polymorphisms could affect CNS drugs disposition, but the genetic factor that alters its activity is still unknown. This fact leads to consider the analysis of ABCB1 haplotypes instead of individual variants. Polymorphisms associated with fentanyl pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and adverse effects Fentanyl is an agonist of the μ‐opioid receptor commonly used in the treatment of moderate‐severe pain. In order to study whether pharmacogenetics explains some of the variability in the response to fentanyl, several genes related to fentanyl receptors, transporters and metabolic enzymes have been analysed. Thirty‐five healthy volunteers (19 men and 16 women) receiving a single 300 μg oral dose of fentanyl were genotyped for 9 polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), ATP‐binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1), catechol‐O‐methyltransferase (COMT) and adrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB2) by real‐time PCR. Fentanyl concentrations were measured by ultra‐performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC‐MS/MS). Fentanyl pharmacokinetics is affected by sex. Carriers of the CYP3A4*22 allele, which is known to reduce the mRNA expression, showed higher area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) and lower clearance (Cl) values. Although this finding might be of importance, its validity needs to be confirmed in other similar settings. Furthermore, carriers of the ABCB1 C1236T T/T genotype presented a lower AUC and higher Cl, as well as lower half‐life (T1/2). As volunteers were blocked with naltrexone, the effect of fentanyl on pharmacodynamics might be biased; however, we could observe that fentanyl had a hypotensive effect. Moreover, ADRB2 C523A A allele carriers showed a tendency towards reducing systolic blood pressure. Likewise, OPRM1 and COMT minor allele variants were risk factors for the development of somnolence. CYP3A5*3, ABCB1 C3435T and ABCB1 G2677T/A were not associated with fentanyl\\'s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile. A clinical and histopathological study of malformations observed in fetuses infected by the Zika virus Background: The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the associated increased prevalence of microcephaly in Brazil underline the impact of viral infections on embryo fetal development. The aim of the present study is to provide a detailed clinical and histopathological study of the fetal disruption caused by the ZIKV, with a special focus on the associated neuropathological findings. Methods: A detailed feto-placental examination, as well as neuropathological and neurobiological studies were performed on three fetuses collected after pregnancy termination between 22 and 25 weeks of gestation (WG), because brain malformations associated with a maternal and fetal ZIKV infection was diagnosed. Results: In all three cases, the maternal infection occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy. A small head was observed on the ultrasound examination of the second trimester of pregnancy and led to the diagnosis of ZIKV fetopathy and pregnancy termination. The fetal histopathological examination was unremarkable on the viscera but showed on the testis an interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate. The placenta contained a Hofbauer cells hyperplasia with signs of inflammation. Neuropathological findings included a meningoencephalitis and an ex vacuo hydrocephalus. Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of T lymphocytic and histiocytic meningitis associated with an abundant cerebral astroglial and macrophagic reaction. In situ hybridization demonstrated, abundant ZIKV particles within the cerebral parenchyma mainly in the ventricular/subventricular zone and in the cortical plate. In addition massive cells death and endoplasmic reticulum damage were present. Conclusion: The present study reports on the clinical and histopathological findings observed in three fetuses infected by the ZIKV. It emphasizes the severity of brain damages and the minimal visceral and placental changes observed upon ZIKV infection. This confirms the selective neurotropism of ZIKV. Finally, it allows us to describe the cascade of multifactorial developmental defects leading to microcephaly. © 2018 International Society of Neuropathology GPCRdb: the G protein-coupled receptor database - an introduction Abstract GPCRs make up the largest family of human membrane proteins and of drug targets. Recent advances in GPCR pharmacology and crystallography have shed new light on signal transduction, allosteric modulation and biased signalling, translating into new mechanisms and principles for drug design. The GPCR database, GPCRdb, has served the community for over 20\\xa0years and has recently been extended to include a more multidisciplinary audience. This review is intended to introduce new users to the services in GPCRdb, which meets three overall purposes: firstly, to provide reference data in an integrated, annotated and structured fashion, with a focus on sequences, structures, single‐point mutations and ligand interactions. Secondly, to equip the community with a suite of web tools for swift analysis of structures, sequence similarities, receptor relationships, and ligand target profiles. Thirdly, to facilitate dissemination through interactive diagrams of, for example, receptor residue topologies, phylogenetic relationships and crystal structure statistics. Herein, these services are described for the first time; visitors and guides are provided with good practices for their utilization. Finally, we describe complementary databases cross‐referenced by GPCRdb and web servers with corresponding functionality. Clinical and Functional Relevance of the Monocarboxylate Transporter Family in Disease Pathophysiology and Drug Therapy Abstract The solute carrier (SLC) SLC16 gene family comprises 14 members and encodes for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which mediate the absorption and distribution of monocarboxylic compounds across plasma membranes. As the knowledge about their physiological function, activity, and regulation increases, their involvement and contribution to cancer and other diseases become increasingly evident. Moreover, promising opportunities for therapeutic interventions by directly targeting their endogenous functions or by exploiting their ability to deliver drugs to specific organ sites emerge. Mnemonic and attentional roles for states of attenuated alpha oscillations in perceptual working memory: a review Alpha oscillations are often reported to be amplified during working memory retention, serving to disengage sensory areas to protect internal representations from external interference. At the same time, contemporary views of working memory postulate that sensory areas may often also be recruited for retention. I here review recent evidence that during such \\'perceptual\\' working memory, alpha oscillations in mnemonically relevant sensory areas are not amplified but attenuated instead. I will argue that such attenuated alpha states serve a mnemonic role and, further, that larger attenuation may support item-specific attentional prioritisation within perceptual working memory. In critically evaluating this role, I also consider (and argue against) four alternatives to a strictly mnemonic account of the available data that may also prove useful to consider in future research. Finally, I highlight key implications of these data for the study of working memory and for our understanding of the functional roles of states of attenuated alpha oscillations in cognition. The effects of subcurative praziquantel treatment on life-history traits and trade-offs in drug-resistant Schistosoma mansoni Abstract Natural selection acts on all organisms, including parasites, to maximize reproductive fitness. Drug resistance traits are often associated with life‐history costs in the absence of treatment. Schistosomiasis control programmes rely on mass drug administration to reduce human morbidity and mortality. Although hotspots of reduced drug efficacy have been reported, resistance is not widespread. Using Bayesian state‐space models (SSMs) fitted to data from an in vivo laboratory system, we tested the hypothesis that the spread of resistant Schistosoma mansoni may be limited by life‐history costs not present in susceptible counterparts. S. mansoni parasites from a praziquantel‐susceptible (S), a praziquantel‐resistant (R) or a mixed line of originally resistant and susceptible parasites (RS) were exposed to a range of praziquantel doses. Parasite numbers at each life stage were quantified in their molluscan intermediate and murine definitive hosts across four generations, and SSMs were used to estimate key life‐history parameters for each experimental group over time. Model outputs illustrated that parasite adult survival and fecundity in the murine host decreased across all lines, including R, with increasing drug pressure. Trade‐offs between adult survival and fecundity were observed in all untreated lines, and these remained strong in S with praziquantel pressure. In contrast, trade‐offs between adult survival and fecundity were lost under praziquantel pressure in R. As expected, parasite life‐history traits within the molluscan host were complex, but trade‐offs were demonstrated between parasite establishment and cercarial output. The observed trade‐offs between generations within hosts, which were modified by praziquantel treatment in the R line, could limit the spread of R parasites under praziquantel pressure. Whilst such complex life‐history costs may be difficult to detect using standard empirical methods, we demonstrate that SSMs provide robust estimates of life‐history parameters, aiding our understanding of costs and trade‐offs of resistant parasites within this system and beyond. Selection on skewed characters and the paradox of stasis Observed phenotypic responses to selection in the wild often differ from predictions based on measurements of selection and genetic variance. An overlooked hypothesis to explain this paradox of stasis is that a skewed phenotypic distribution affects natural selection and evolution. We show through mathematical modelling that, when a trait selected for an optimum phenotype has a skewed distribution, directional selection is detected even at evolutionary equilibrium, where it causes no change in the mean phenotype. When environmental effects are skewed, Lande and Arnold\\'s (1983) directional gradient is in the direction opposite to the skew. In contrast, skewed breeding values can displace the mean phenotype from the optimum, causing directional selection in the direction of the skew. These effects can be partitioned out using alternative selection estimates based on average derivatives of individual relative fitness, or additive genetic covariances between relative fitness and trait (Robertson-Price identity). We assess the validity of these predictions using simulations of selection estimation under moderate samples size. Ecologically relevant traits may commonly have skewed distributions, as we here exemplify with avian laying date – repeatedly described as more evolutionarily stable than expected –, so this skewness should be accounted for when investigating evolutionary dynamics in the wild.

Nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions from inland waters remain a major source of uncertainty in global greenhouse gas budgets. N2 O emissions are typically estimated using emission factors (EFs), defined as the proportion of the terrestrial nitrogen (N) load to a water body that is emitted as N2 O to the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has proposed EFs of 0.25% and 0.75%, though studies have suggested that both these values are either too high or too low. In this work, we develop a mechanistic modeling approach to explicitly predict N2 O production and emissions via nitrification and denitrification in rivers, reservoirs and estuaries. In particular, we introduce a water residence time dependence, which kinetically limits the extent of denitrification and nitrification in water bodies. We revise existing spatially explicit estimates of N loads to inland waters to predict both lumped watershed and half-degree grid cell emissions and EFs worldwide, as well as the proportions of these emissions that originate from denitrification and nitrification. We estimate global inland water N2 O emissions of 10.6-19.8\\xa0Gmol\\xa0N\\xa0year-1 (148-277\\xa0Gg\\xa0N\\xa0year-1 ), with reservoirs producing most N2 O per unit area. Our results indicate that IPCC EFs are likely overestimated by up to an order of magnitude, and that achieving the magnitude of the IPCC\\'s EFs is kinetically improbable in most river systems. Denitrification represents the major pathway of N2 O production in river systems, whereas nitrification dominates production in reservoirs and estuaries. Volatile emissions from thawing permafrost soils are influenced by meltwater drainage conditions Vast amounts of carbon are bound in both active layer and permafrost soils in the Arctic. As a consequence of climate warming, the depth of the active layer is increasing in size and permafrost soils are thawing. We hypothesize that pulses of biogenic volatile organic compounds are released from the near-surface active layer during spring, and during late summer season from thawing permafrost, while the subsequent biogeochemical processes occurring in thawed soils also lead to emissions. Biogenic volatile organic compounds are reactive gases that have both negative and positive climate forcing impacts when introduced to the Arctic atmosphere, and the knowledge of their emission magnitude and pattern is necessary to construct reliable climate models. However, it is unclear how different ecosystems and environmental factors such as drainage conditions upon permafrost thaw affect the emission and compound composition. Here we show that incubations of frozen B horizon of the active layer and permafrost soils collected from a High Arctic heath and fen release a range of biogenic volatile organic compounds upon thaw and during subsequent incubation experiments at temperatures of 10°C and 20°C. Meltwater drainage in the fen soils increased emission rates nine times, while having no effect in the drier heath soils. Emissions generally increased with temperature, and emission profiles for the fen soils were dominated by benzenoids and alkanes, while benzenoids, ketones, and alcohols dominated in heath soils. Our results emphasize that future changes affecting the drainage conditions of the Arctic tundra will have a large influence on volatile emissions from thawing permafrost soils – particularly in wetland/fen areas. Estimating aboveground net biomass change for tropical and subtropical forests: Refinement of IPCC default rates using forest plot data Abstract As countries advance in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for climate change mitigation, consistent estimates of aboveground net biomass change (∆AGB) are needed. Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old‐growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old‐growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests (≤20\\xa0years), older secondary forests (>20\\xa0years and up to 100\\xa0years) and old‐growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg\\xa0ha−1\\xa0year−1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg\\xa0ha−1\\xa0year−1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg\\xa0ha−1\\xa0year−1 in old‐growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large‐scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research. Origin of volatile organic compound emissions from subarctic tundra under global warming Abstract Warming occurs in the Arctic twice as fast as the global average, which in turn leads to a large enhancement in terpenoid emissions from vegetation. Volatile terpenoids are the main class of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play crucial roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate. However, the biochemical mechanisms behind the temperature‐dependent increase in VOC emissions from subarctic ecosystems are largely unexplored. Using 13CO2‐labeling, we studied the origin of VOCs and the carbon (C) allocation under global warming in the soil–plant–atmosphere system of contrasting subarctic heath tundra vegetation communities characterized by dwarf shrubs of the genera Salix or Betula. The projected temperature rise of the subarctic summer by 5°C was realistically simulated in sophisticated climate chambers. VOC emissions strongly depended on the plant species composition of the heath tundra. Warming caused increased VOC emissions and significant changes in the pattern of volatiles toward more reactive hydrocarbons. The 13C was incorporated to varying degrees in different monoterpene and sesquiterpene isomers. We found that de novo monoterpene biosynthesis contributed to 40%–44% (Salix) and 60%–68% (Betula) of total monoterpene emissions under the current climate, and that warming increased the contribution to 50%–58% (Salix) and 87%–95% (Betula). Analyses of above‐ and belowground 12/13C showed shifts of C allocation in the plant–soil systems and negative effects of warming on C sequestration by lowering net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and increasing C loss as VOCs. This comprehensive analysis provides the scientific basis for mechanistically understanding the processes controlling terpenoid emissions, required for modeling VOC emissions from terrestrial ecosystems and predicting the future chemistry of the arctic atmosphere. By changing the chemical composition and loads of VOCs into the atmosphere, the current data indicate that global warming in the Arctic may have implications for regional and global climate and for the delicate tundra ecosystems. Impact of left atrial volume, sphericity, and fibrosis on the outcome of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation INTRODUCTION To investigate the relation between left atrial (LA) volume, sphericity, and fibrotic content derived from contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CE-CMR) and their impact on the outcome of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS In 83 patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, CE-CMR was used to assess LA volume, sphericity, and fibrosis. There was a significant correlation between LA volume and sphericity (R\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.535, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and between LA volume and fibrosis (R\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.241, P\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.029). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that LA volume was the strongest independent predictor of AF recurrence after catheter ablation (1.019, P\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.018). CONCLUSION LA volume, sphericity, and fibrosis were closely related; however, LA volume was the strongest predictor of AF recurrence after catheter ablation. Postprocedural LGE-CMR comparison of laser and radiofrequency ablation lesions after pulmonary vein isolation INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to compare the anatomical characteristics of scar formation achieved by visual-guided laser balloon (Laser) and radiofrequency (RF) pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), using late-gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMR). METHODS AND RESULTS We included 17 patients with paroxysmal or early persistent drug resistant AF who underwent Laser ablation; 2 were excluded due to procedure-related complications. The sample was matched with a historical group of 15 patients who underwent PVI using RF. LGE-CMR sequences were acquired before and 3 months post-PVI. Ablation gaps were defined as pulmonary vein (PV) perimeter sections showing no gadolinium enhancement. The number of ablation gaps was lower in Laser versus RF ablations (median 7\\xa0vs. 14, P\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.015). Complete anatomical PVI (circumferential scar around PV, without gaps) was more frequently achieved with Laser than with RF (39%\\xa0vs. 19% of PVs, P\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa00.025). Fewer gaps were present at the superior and anterior left PV and posterior right PV antral regions in the Laser group, compared to RF. Scar extension into the PVs was similar in both groups, although RF produced more extensive ablation scar toward the LA body. AF recurrences at 1 year were similar in both groups (Laser 36%\\xa0vs. RF 27%, P\\xa0\\xa0=\\xa0\\xa01.00). CONCLUSIONS Compared to RF, Laser ablation achieved more complete anatomical PVI, with less LA scar extension. However, AF recurrence appears to be similar after Laser compared to RF ablation. Further studies are needed to assess whether the anatomical advantages of Laser ablation translate into clinical benefit in patients with AF. Reference measurement procedure for CSF amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42and the CSF Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40ratio - a cross-validation study against amyloid PET A clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease is currently made on the basis of results from cognitive tests in combination with medical history and general clinical evaluation, but the peptide amyloid-beta (Aβ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is increasingly used as a biomarker for amyloid pathology in clinical trials and in recently proposed revised clinical criteria for Alzheimer\\'s disease. Recent analytical developments have resulted in mass spectrometry (MS) reference measurement procedures for absolute quantification of Aβ1–42 in CSF. The CSF Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio has been suggested to improve the detection of cerebral amyloid deposition, by compensating for inter-individual variations in total Aβ production. Our aim was to cross-validate the reference measurement procedure as well as the Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42/Aβ1–38 ratios in CSF, measured by high-resolution MS, with the cortical level of Aβ fibrils as measured by amyloid (18F-flutemetamol) positron emission tomography (PET). We included 100 non-demented patients with cognitive symptoms from the Swedish BioFINDER study, all of whom had undergone both lumbar puncture and 18F-flutemetamol PET. Comparing CSF Aβ1–42 concentrations with 18F-flutemetamol PET showed high concordance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 and a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 81%, respectively. The ratio of Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42/Aβ1–38 significantly improved concordance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 91%, respectively. These results show that the CSF Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42/Aβ1–38 ratios using the described MS method are strongly associated with cortical Aβ fibrils measured by 18F-flutemetamol PET. Current controversies in determining the main mechanisms of atrial fibrillation Despite considerable basic research into the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF), not much progress has been made in the prognosis of patients with AF. With the exception of anticoagulant therapy, current treatments for AF still do not improve major cardiovascular outcomes. This may be due partly to the diverse aetiology of AF with increasingly more factors found to contribute to the arrhythmia. In addition, a strong increase has been seen in the technological complexity of the methods used to quantify the main pathophysiological alterations underlying the initiation and progression of AF. Because of the lack of standardization of the technological approaches currently used, the perception of basic mechanisms of AF varies widely in the scientific community. Areas of debate include the role of Ca2+-handling alterations associated with AF, the contribution and noninvasive assessment of the degree of atrial fibrosis, and the best techniques to identify electrophysiological drivers of AF. In this review, we will summarize the state of the art of these controversial topics and describe the diverse approaches to investigating and the scientific opinions on leading AF mechanisms. Finally, we will highlight the need for transparency in scientific reporting and standardization of terminology, assumptions, algorithms and experimental conditions used for the development of better AF therapies. Causal inference in obesity research Obesity is a risk factor for a plethora of severe morbidities and premature death. Most supporting evidence comes from observational studies that are prone to chance, bias and confounding. Even data on the protective effects of weight loss from randomized controlled trials will be susceptible to confounding and bias if treatment assignment cannot be masked, which is usually the case with lifestyle and surgical interventions. Thus, whilst obesity is widely considered the major modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases, its causes and consequences are often difficult to determine. Addressing this is important, as the prevention and treatment of any disease requires that interventions focus on causal risk factors. Disease prediction, although not dependent on knowing the causes, is nevertheless enhanced by such knowledge. Here, we provide an overview of some of the barriers to causal inference in obesity research and discuss analytical approaches, such as Mendelian randomization, that can help to overcome these obstacles. In a systematic review of the literature in this field, we found: (i) probable causal relationships between adiposity and bone health/disease, cancers (colorectal, lung and kidney cancers), cardiometabolic traits (blood pressure, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers and lipids), uric acid concentrations, coronary heart disease and venous thrombosis (in the presence of pulmonary embolism), (ii) possible causal relationships between adiposity and gray matter volume, depression and common mental disorders, oesophageal cancer, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, nuclear cataract and gall stone disease, and (iii) no evidence for causal relationships between adiposity and Alzheimer\\'s disease, pancreatic cancer, venous thrombosis (in the absence of pulmonary embolism), liver function and periodontitis. Shear-wave elastography of the liver and spleen identifies clinically significant portal hypertension: A prospective multicentre study Abstract: Background & Aims Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is associated with severe complications and decompensation of cirrhosis. Liver stiffness measured either by transient elastography (TE) or Shear-wave elastography (SWE) and spleen stiffness by TE might be helpful in the diagnosis of CSPH. We recently showed the algorithm to rule-out CSPH using sequential liver- (L-SWE) and spleen-Shear-wave elastography (S-SWE). This study investigated the diagnostic value of S-SWE for diagnosis of CSPH. Methods One hundred and fifty-eight cirrhotic patients with pressure gradient measurements were included into this prospective multicentre study. L-SWE was measured in 155 patients, S-SWE in 112 patients, and both in 109 patients. Results Liver-shear-wave elastography and S-SWE correlated with clinical events and decompensation. SWE of liver and spleen revealed strong correlations with the pressure gradient and to differentiate between patients with and without CSPH. The best cut-off values were 24.6 kPa:L-SWE and 26.3 kPa:S-SWE. L-SWE ≤16.0 kPa and S-SWE ≤21.7 kPa were able to rule-out CSPH. Cut-off values of L-SWE >29.5 kPa and S-SWE >35.6 kPa were able to rule-in CSPH (specificity >92%). Patients with a L-SWE >38.0 kPa had likely CSPH. In patients with L-SWE ≤38.0 kPa, a S-SWE >27.9 kPa ruled in CSPH. This algorithm has a sensitivity of 89.2% and a specificity of 91.4% to rule-in CSPH. Patients not fulfilling these criteria may undergo HVPG measurement. Conclusions Liver and spleen SWE correlate with portal pressure and can both be used as a non-invasive method to investigate CSPH. Even though external validation is still missing, these algorithms to rule-out and rule-in CSPH using sequential SWE of liver and spleen might change the clinical practice. Metabolic syndrome and severity of fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: An age-dependent risk profiling study Background & Aims Metabolic syndrome (MS) and its individual components are associated with the severity and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We sought to evaluate the relationship between MS components and the risk of severe hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD patients discriminated by age. Methods We considered 863 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, who had been fully evaluated for components of MS. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that F3-F4 was associated with visceral obesity, IFG/diabetes, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but not triglycerides >150 or arterial hypertension. A significant interaction was found between age and visceral obesity (P=.04). By stratifying patients for age, we confirmed the interaction between inclusion in the third age tertile (>54\\xa0years) and visceral obesity (P=.04). In the lower ( 54\\xa0years), obesity did not affect the severity of fibrosis, and the risk of severe fibrosis was higher in those with low HDL and IFG/diabetes with/without visceral obesity (52%-54%). Conclusions Among patients with NAFLD, the metabolic profiles associated with risk for severe fibrosis varied among age groups. Low HDL, obesity and IFG/diabetes were prevalent among patients in the lower and middle age tertiles. HDL and IFG/diabetes but not visceral obesity were prevalent among those in the highest age tertile. Circulating CXCL10 in cirrhotic portal hypertension might reflect systemic inflammation and predict ACLF and mortality BACKGROUND & AIMS: CXCR% ligands play an important role in hepatic injury, inflammation and fibrosis. While CXCL9 and CXCL11 are associated with survival in patients receiving transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), the role of CXCL10 in severe portal hypertension remains unknown. METHODS: A total of 89 cirrhotic patients were analysed. CXCL10 protein levels were measured in portal and hepatic blood at TIPS insertion and 2 weeks later in 24 patients. CXCL10 and IL8 levels were assessed in portal, hepatic, cubital vein and right atrium blood in a further 25 patients at TIPS insertion. Furthermore, real-time PCR determined hepatic CXCL10-mRNA in 40 cirrhotic patients. RESULTS: Hepatic CXCL10 showed no association with decompensation. By contrast, circulating CXCL10-levels were higher in portal than in hepatic vein blood, suggesting an extrahepatic source of CXCL10 in cirrhosis. However, CXCL10 protein in blood samples from portal, hepatic, cubital veins and right atrium correlated excellently with each other and with IL-8 levels. Higher CXCL10 circulating levels were associated with presence of ascites and higher Child scores. Higher CXCL10 circulating protein levels were associated with acute decompensation, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and independently with mortality. Moreover, a decrease in CXCL10 protein levels after TIPS insertion was associated with better survival in each cohort and analysed together. DISCUSSION: Circulating CXCL10 possibly reflects systemic inflammation and it is correlated with acute decompensation, ACLF and complications in patients with severe portal hypertension receiving TIPS. CXCL10 predicts survival in these patients and a decrease in CXCL10 after TIPS may be considered a good prognostic factor. Collagen type IV remodelling gender‐specifically predicts mortality in decompensated cirrhosis BACKGROUND & AIMS: Remodelling of extracellular matrix is crucial in progressive liver fibrosis. Collagen type III desposition has been shown in acute decompensation. Extratracellular matrix is compiled of deposition of various components. The role of basement membrane collagen type IV in advanced cirrhosis and acute decompensation is unclear and investigated in this study. METHODS: Patients with decompensated cirrhosis from the prospective NEPTUN cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03628807), who underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure were included. Clinical and laboratory parameters, PRO-C4 and C4M levels were measured in blood samples from portal and hepatic veins just before transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. RESULTS: Levels of C4M and PRO-C4 are significantly lower in patients with massive ascites and impaired renal sodium excretion. C4M and PRO-C4 show gender-specific profiles with significantly lower levels in females compared to males. Females with higher C4M levels show higher mortality. By contrast, males with higher C4M levels show lower mortality. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, C4M is an independent predictor of survival in female patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that markers of collagen type IV remodelling do not accumulate in severe renal dysfunction. Although collagen type IV degradation markers derive from the liver, portal venous C4M levels are relevant for survival. Moreover, it demonstrates that circulating C4M shows gender-specific profiles, which can independently predict survival in female patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Genomic changes underlying host specialization in the bee gut symbiont\\n            Lactobacillus\\n            Firm5 AbstractBacteria that engage in longstanding associations with particular hosts are expected to evolve host-specific adaptations that limit their capacity to thrive in other environments. Consistent with this, many gut symbionts seem to have a limited host range, based on community profiling and phylogenomics. However, few studies have experimentally investigated host specialization of gut symbionts and underlying mechanisms have largely remained elusive. Here, we studied host specialization of a dominant gut symbiont of social bees, Lactobacillus Firm5. We show that Firm5 strains isolated from honey bees and bumble bees separate into deep-branching host-specific phylogenetic lineages. Despite their divergent evolution, colonization experiments show that bumble bee strains are capable of colonizing the honey bee gut. However, they were less successful than honey bee strains, and competition with honey bee strains completely abolished their colonization. In contrast honey bee strains of divergent phylogenetic lineages were able to coexist within individual bees. This suggests that both host selection and interbacterial competition play important roles for host specialization. Using comparative genomics of 27 Firm5 isolates, we found that the genomes of honey bee strains harbor more carbohydrate-related functions than bumble bee strains, possibly providing a competitive advantage in the honey bee gut. Remarkably, most of the genes encoding carbohydrate-related functions were not conserved among the honey bee strains, which suggests that honey bees can support a metabolically more diverse community of Firm5 strains than bumble bees. These findings advance our understanding of genomic changes underlying host specialization. Vectorial status of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus\\n of La Réunion Island for Zika virus International audience; La Réunion Island has been the scene of unusually large epidemics of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses with Aedes albopictus Diptera, Culicidae (Skuse, 1894) as the sole vector. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in 2007 and the spread of the epidemic strain of the Asian genotype through the Pacific region and the Americas, mainly via the vector Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), has raised concern about its possible introduction to, and transmission in, Ae. albopictus-infested areas. We performed an experimental oral infection with the Asian genotype of ZIKV in Ae. albopictus from La Réunion and found a strong midgut barrier to dissemination. This result is discussed in the light of previous vector competence assays for DENV and CHIKV performed by our team on other Ae. albopictus populations from La Réunion. Review: Tau in biofluids - relation to pathology, imaging and clinical features Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that is important for the stability of neuronal axons. It is normally expressed within neurons and is also secreted into the brain interstitial fluid that communicates freely with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, in a more restricted manner, blood via the glymphatic clearance system of the brain. In Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD), neuroaxonal degeneration results in increased release of tau from neurons. Further, tau is truncated and phosphorylated, which leads to aggregation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles of the proximal axoplasm. Neuroaxonal degeneration and tangle formation are reflected by increased concentrations of total tau (T-tau, measured using assays that detect most forms of tau) and phospho-tau (P-tau, measured using assays with antibodies specific to phosphorylated forms of tau). In AD CSF, both T-tau and P-tau concentrations are increased. In stroke and other CNS disorders with neuroaxonal injury but without tangles, T-tau is selectively increased, whilst P-tau concentration often stays normal. In tauopathies (diseases with both neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles) other than AD, CSF T-tau and P-tau concentrations are typically unaltered, which is a puzzling result that warrants further investigation. In the current review, I discuss the association of T-tau and P-tau concentrations in body fluids with neuropathological changes, imaging findings and clinical features in AD and other CNS diseases.

Plant temperature responses vary geographically, reflecting thermally contrasting habitats and long‐term species adaptations to their climate of origin. Plants also can acclimate to fast temporal changes in temperature regime to mitigate stress. Although plant photosynthetic responses are known to acclimate to temperature, many global models used to predict future vegetation and climate–carbon interactions do not include this process. 2. We quantify the global and regional impacts of biogeographical variability and thermal acclimation of temperature response of photosynthetic capacity on the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle between 1860 and 2100 within a coupled climate–carbon cycle model, that emulates 22 global climate models. 3. Results indicate that inclusion of biogeographical variation in photosynthetic temperature response is most important for present‐day and future C uptake, with increasing importance of thermal acclimation under future warming. Accounting for both effects narrows the range of predictions of the simulated global land C storage in 2100 across climate projections (29% and 43% globally and in the tropics, respectively). 4. Contrary to earlier studies, our results suggest that thermal acclimation of photosynthetic capacity makes tropical and temperate C less vulnerable to warming, but reduces the warming‐induced C uptake in the boreal region under elevated CO2. PITX2\\n-dependent gene regulation in atrial fibrillation and rhythm control Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia. Better prevention and treatment of AF are needed to reduce AF‐associated morbidity and mortality. There are several major mechanisms that cause AF in patients, including a genetic predisposition to develop AF. Genome‐wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with AF populations, with the strongest hits clustering on chromosome 4q25, close to the gene for the homeobox transcription factor PITX2. The effect of these common gene variants on cardiac PITX2 mRNA is currently under study. PITX2 protein regulates right–left differentiation of the embryonic heart, thorax and aorta. PITX2 is expressed in the adult left atrium, but much less so in other heart chambers. Pitx2 deficiency results in electrical and structural remodelling, and impaired repair of the heart in murine models, all of which may influence AF through divergent mechanisms. PITX2 levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 4q25 may also be a predictor of the effectiveness of anti‐arrhythmic drug therapy. Preflight characterization of the BLAST-TNG receiver and detector arrays The Next Generation Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST-TNG) is a submillimeter mapping experiment planned for a 28 day long-duration balloon (LDB) flight from McMurdo Station, Antarctica during the 2018-2019 season. BLAST-TNG will detect submillimeter polarized interstellar dust emission, tracing magnetic fields in galactic molecular clouds. BLAST-TNG will be the first polarimeter with the sensitivity and resolution to probe the _$\\\\sim_$0.1 parsec-scale features that are critical to understanding the origin of structures in the interstellar medium. BLAST-TNG features three detector arrays operating at wavelengths of 250, 350, and 500 _$\\\\mu_$m (1200, 857, and 600 GHz) comprised of 918, 469, and 272 dual-polarization pixels, respectively. Each pixel is made up of two crossed microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). These arrays are cooled to 275 mK in a cryogenic receiver. Each MKID has a different resonant frequency, allowing hundreds of resonators to be read out on a single transmission line. This inherent ability to be frequency-domain multiplexed simplifies the cryogenic readout hardware, but requires careful optical testing to map out the physical location of each resonator on the focal plane. Receiver-level optical testing was carried out using both a cryogenic source mounted to a movable xy-stage with a shutter, and a beam-filling, heated blackbody source able to provide a 10-50 _$^\\\\circ_$C temperature chop. The focal plane array noise properties, responsivity, polarization efficiency, instrumental polarization were measured. We present the preflight characterization of the BLAST-TNG cryogenic system and array-level optical testing of the MKID detector arrays in the flight receiver. Unlocking data sets by calibrating populations of models to data density: A study in atrial electrophysiology The understanding of complex physical or biological systems nearly always requires a characterization of the variability that underpins these processes. In addition, the data used to calibrate these models may also often exhibit considerable variability. A recent approach to deal with these issues has been to calibrate populations of models (POMs), multiple copies of a single mathematical model but with different parameter values, in response to experimental data. To date, this calibration has been largely limited to selecting models that produce outputs that fall within the ranges of the data set, ignoring any trends that might be present in the data. We present here a novel and general methodology for calibrating POMs to the distributions of a set of measured values in a data set. We demonstrate our technique using a data set from a cardiac electrophysiology study based on the differences in atrial action potential readings between patients exhibiting sinus rhythm (SR) or chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) and the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel model for human atrial action potentials. Not only does our approach accurately capture the variability inherent in the experimental population, but we also demonstrate how the POMs that it produces may be used to extract additional information from the data used for calibration, including improved identification of the differences underlying stratified data. We also show how our approach allows different hypotheses regarding the variability in complex systems to be quantitatively compared. Stabilization of fault slip by fluid injection in the laboratory and in situ Faults can slip seismically or aseismically depending on their hydromechanical properties, which can be measured in the laboratory. Here, we demonstrate that fault slip induced by fluid injection in a natural fault at the decametric scale is quantitatively consistent with fault slip and frictional properties measured in the laboratory. The increase in fluid pressure first induces accelerating aseismic creep and fault opening. As the fluid pressure increases further, friction becomes mainly rate strengthening, favoring aseismic slip. Our study reveals how coupling between fault slip and fluid flow promotes stable fault creep during fluid injection. Seismicity is most probably triggered indirectly by the fluid injection due to loading of nonpressurized fault patches by aseismic creep. Spider dragline silk as torsional actuator driven by humidity Self-powered actuation driven by ambient humidity is of practical interest for applications such as hygroscopic artificial muscles. We demonstrate that spider dragline silk exhibits a humidity-induced torsional deformation of more than 300°/mm. When the relative humidity reaches a threshold of about 70%, the dragline silk starts to generate a large twist deformation independent of spider species. The torsional actuation can be precisely controlled by regulating the relative humidity. The behavior of humidity-induced twist is related to the supercontraction behavior of spider dragline silk. Specifically, molecular simulations of MaSp1 and MaSp2 proteins in dragline silk reveal that the unique torsional property originates from the presence of proline in MaSp2. The large proline rings also contribute to steric exclusion and disruption of hydrogen bonding in the molecule. This property of dragline silk and its structural origin can inspire novel design of torsional actuators or artificial muscles and enable the development of designer biomaterials. Past warming trend constrains future warming in CMIP6 models Future global warming estimates have been similar across past assessments, but several climate models of the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) simulate much stronger warming, apparently inconsistent with past assessments. Here, we show that projected future warming is correlated with the simulated warming trend during recent decades across CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, enabling us to constrain future warming based on consistency with the observed warming. These findings carry important policy-relevant implications: The observationally constrained CMIP6 median warming in high emissions and ambitious mitigation scenarios is over 16 and 14% lower by 2050 compared to the raw CMIP6 median, respectively, and over 14 and 8% lower by 2090, relative to 1995–2014. Observationally constrained CMIP6 warming is consistent with previous assessments based on CMIP5 models, and in an ambitious mitigation scenario, the likely range is consistent with reaching the Paris Agreement target. Direct and seasonal legacy effects of the 2018 heat wave and drought on European ecosystem productivity In summer 2018, central and northern Europe were stricken by extreme drought and heat (DH2018). The DH2018 differed from previous events in being preceded by extreme spring warming and brightening, but moderate rainfall deficits, yet registering the fastest transition between wet winter conditions and extreme summer drought. Using 11 vegetation models, we show that spring conditions promoted increased vegetation growth, which, in turn, contributed to fast soil moisture depletion, amplifying the summer drought. We find regional asymmetries in summer ecosystem carbon fluxes: increased (reduced) sink in the northern (southern) areas affected by drought. These asymmetries can be explained by distinct legacy effects of spring growth and of water-use efficiency dynamics mediated by vegetation composition, rather than by distinct ecosystem responses to summer heat/drought. The asymmetries in carbon and water exchanges during spring and summer 2018 suggest that future land-management strategies could influence patterns of summer heat waves and droughts under long-term warming. Exposing the exposures responsible for type 2 diabetes and obesity The rising prevalences of type 2 diabetes and obesity constitute major threats to human health globally. Powerful social and economic factors influence the distribution of these diseases among and within populations. These factors act on a substrate of individual predisposition derived from the composite effects of inherited DNA variation and a range of environmental exposures experienced throughout the life course. Although “Western” lifestyle represents a convenient catch-all culprit for such exposures, effective treatment and prevention will be informed by characterization of the most critical, causal environmental factors. In this Review, we examine how burgeoning understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes and obesity can highlight nongenetic exposures that drive development of these conditions. Toward dynamic structural biology: Two decades of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer Classical structural biology can only provide static snapshots of biomacromolecules. Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) paved the way for studying dynamics in macromolecular structures under biologically relevant conditions. Since its first implementation in 1996, smFRET experiments have confirmed previously hypothesized mechanisms and provided new insights into many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA maintenance and repair, transcription, translation, and membrane transport. We review 22 years of contributions of smFRET to our understanding of basic mechanisms in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology. Additionally, building on current state-of-the-art implementations of smFRET, we highlight possible future directions for smFRET in applications such as biosensing, high-throughput screening, and molecular diagnostics. Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals Chemical manufacturing is often done at large facilities that require a sizable capital investment and then produce key compounds for a finite period. We present an approach to the manufacturing of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals in a self-contained plastic reactionware device. The device was designed and constructed by using a chemical to computer-automated design (ChemCAD) approach that enables the translation of traditional bench-scale synthesis into a platform-independent digital code. This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed device that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist facilities. Organic synthesis in a modular robotic system driven by a chemical programming language The synthesis of complex organic compounds is largely a manual process that is often incompletely documented. To address these shortcomings, we developed an abstraction that maps commonly reported methodological instructions into discrete steps amenable to automation. These unit operations were implemented in a modular robotic platform by using a chemical programming language that formalizes and controls the assembly of the molecules. We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and purities of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually. The syntheses are captured as digital code that can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between platforms with no modification, thereby greatly enhancing reproducibility and reliable access to complex molecules. Multiple sclerosis genomic map implicates peripheral immune cells and microglia in susceptibility We analyzed genetic data of 47,429 multiple sclerosis (MS) and 68,374 control subjects and established a reference map of the genetic architecture of MS that includes 200 autosomal susceptibility variants outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), one chromosome X variant, and 32 variants within the extended MHC. We used an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative susceptibility genes that implicate multiple innate and adaptive pathways distributed across the cellular components of the immune system. Using expression profiles from purified human microglia, we observed enrichment for MS genes in these brain-resident immune cells, suggesting that these may have a role in targeting an autoimmune process to the central nervous system, although MS is most likely initially triggered by perturbation of peripheral immune responses. In-cell architecture of an actively transcribing-translating expressome Structural biology studies performed inside cells can capture molecular machines in action within their native context. In this work, we developed an integrative in-cell structural approach using the genome-reduced human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We combined whole-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry, cellular cryo–electron tomography, and integrative modeling to determine an in-cell architecture of a transcribing and translating expressome at subnanometer resolution. The expressome comprises RNA polymerase (RNAP), the ribosome, and the transcription elongation factors NusG and NusA. We pinpointed NusA at the interface between a NusG-bound elongating RNAP and the ribosome and propose that it can mediate transcription-translation coupling. Translation inhibition dissociated the expressome, whereas transcription inhibition stalled and rearranged it. Thus, the active expressome architecture requires both translation and transcription elongation within the cell. Ebola vaccine R&D: Filling the knowledge gaps With an emphasis on systems analyses, the VSV-EBOVAC project harnesses state-of-the-art technologies that illuminate mechanisms behind the observed immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and ensures that such information is shared among stakeholders. A dose-dependent plasma signature of the safety and immunogenicity of the rVSV-Ebola vaccine in Europe and Africa The 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic affected several African countries, claiming more than 11,000 lives and leaving thousands with ongoing sequelae. Safe and effective vaccines could prevent or limit future outbreaks. The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–vectored Zaire Ebola (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine has shown marked immunogenicity and efficacy in humans but is reactogenic at higher doses. To understand its effects, we examined plasma samples from 115 healthy volunteers from Geneva who received low-dose (LD) or high-dose (HD) vaccine or placebo. Fifteen plasma chemokines/cytokines were assessed at baseline and on days 1, 2 to 3, and 7 after injection. Significant increases in monocyte-mediated MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1β/CCL4, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1Ra, and IL-10 occurred on day 1. A signature explaining 68% of cytokine/chemokine vaccine-response variability was identified. Its score was higher in HD versus LD vaccinees and was associated positively with vaccine viremia and negatively with cytopenia. It was higher in vaccinees with injection-site pain, fever, myalgia, chills, and headache; higher scores reflected increasing severity. In contrast, HD vaccinees who subsequently developed arthritis had lower day 1 scores than other HD vaccinees. Vaccine dose did not influence the signature despite its influence on specific outcomes. The Geneva-derived signature associated strongly (ρ = 0.97) with that of a cohort of 75 vaccinees from a parallel trial in Lambaréné, Gabon. Its score in Geneva HD vaccinees with subsequent arthritis was significantly lower than that in Lambaréné HD vaccinees, none of whom experienced arthritis. This signature, which reveals monocytes’ critical role in rVSV-ZEBOV immunogenicity and safety across doses and continents, should prove useful in assessments of other vaccines. Complete Genome Sequence of\\n                    Escherichia coli\\n                    Strain WG5 ABSTRACT  Escherichia coli strain WG5 is a widely used host for phage detection, including somatic coliphages employed as standard ISO method 10705-1 (2000). Here, we present the complete genome sequence of a commercial E.\\xa0coli WG5 strain. A Novel Marsupial Hepatitis A Virus Corroborates Complex Evolutionary Patterns Shaping the Genus Hepatovirus The discovery of highly diverse nonprimate hepatoviruses illuminated the evolutionary origins of hepatitis A virus (HAV) ancestors in mammals other than primates. Marsupials are ancient mammals that diverged from other Eutheria during the Jurassic. Viruses from marsupials may thus provide important insight into virus evolution. To investigate Hepatovirus macroevolutionary patterns, we sampled 112 opossums in northeastern Brazil. A novel marsupial HAV (MHAV) in the Brazilian common opossum (Didelphis aurita) was detected by nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). MHAV concentration in the liver was high, at 2.5 × 109 RNA copies/g, and at least 300-fold higher than those in other solid organs, suggesting hepatotropism. Hepatovirus seroprevalence in D. aurita was 26.6% as determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Endpoint titers in confirmatory immunofluorescence assays were high, and marsupial antibodies colocalized with anti-HAV control sera, suggesting specificity of serological detection and considerable antigenic relatedness between HAV and MHAV. MHAV showed all genomic hallmarks defining hepatoviruses, including late-domain motifs likely involved in quasi-envelope acquisition, a predicted C-terminal pX extension of VP1, strong avoidance of CpG dinucleotides, and a type 3 internal ribosomal entry site. Translated polyprotein gene sequence distances of at least 23.7% from other hepatoviruses suggested that MHAV represents a novel Hepatovirus species. Conserved predicted cleavage sites suggested similarities in polyprotein processing between HAV and MHAV. MHAV was nested within rodent hepatoviruses in phylogenetic reconstructions, suggesting an ancestral hepatovirus host switch from rodents into marsupials. Cophylogenetic reconciliations of host and hepatovirus phylogenies confirmed that host-independent macroevolutionary patterns shaped the phylogenetic relationships of extant hepatoviruses. Although marsupials are synanthropic and consumed as wild game in Brazil, HAV community protective immunity may limit the zoonotic potential of MHAV. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a ubiquitous cause of acute hepatitis in humans. Recent findings revealed the evolutionary origins of HAV and the genus Hepatovirus defined by HAV in mammals other than primates in general and in small mammals in particular. The factors shaping the genealogy of extant hepatoviruses are unclear. We sampled marsupials, one of the most ancient mammalian lineages, and identified a novel marsupial HAV (MHAV). The novel MHAV shared specific features with HAV, including hepatotropism, antigenicity, genome structure, and a common ancestor in phylogenetic reconstructions. Coevolutionary analyses revealed that host-independent evolutionary patterns contributed most to the current phylogeny of hepatoviruses and that MHAV was the most drastic example of a cross-order host switch of any hepatovirus observed so far. The divergence of marsupials from other mammals offers unique opportunities to investigate HAV species barriers and whether mechanisms of HAV immune control are evolutionarily conserved. High Zika Virus Seroprevalence in Salvador, Northeastern Brazil Limits the Potential for Further Outbreaks Abstract During 2015 to 2016, Brazil reported more Zika virus (ZIKV) cases than any other country, yet population exposure remains unknown. Serological studies of ZIKV are hampered by cross-reactive immune responses against heterologous viruses. We conducted serosurveys for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in 633 individuals prospectively sampled during 2015 to 2016, including microcephaly and non-microcephaly pregnancies, HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis patients, and university staff in Salvador in northeastern Brazil using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests. Sera sampled retrospectively during 2013 to 2015 from 277 HIV-infected patients were used to assess the spread of ZIKV over time. Individuals were georeferenced, and sociodemographic indicators were compared between ZIKV-positive and -negative areas and areas with and without microcephaly cases. Epidemiological key parameters were modeled in a Bayesian framework. ZIKV seroprevalence increased rapidly during 2015 to 2016, reaching 63.3% by 2016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.4 to 66.8%), comparable to the seroprevalence of DENV (75.7%; CI, 69.4 to 81.1%) and higher than that of CHIKV (7.4%; CI, 5.6 to 9.8%). Of 19 microcephaly pregnancies, 94.7% showed ZIKV IgG antibodies, compared to 69.3% of 257 non-microcephaly pregnancies (P = 0.017). Analyses of sociodemographic data revealed a higher ZIKV burden in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas. High seroprevalence, combined with case data dynamics allowed estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 of 2.1 (CI, 1.8 to 2.5) at the onset of the outbreak and an effective reproductive number Reff of <1 in subsequent years. Our data corroborate ZIKV-associated congenital disease and an association of low SES and ZIKV infection and suggest that population immunity caused cessation of the outbreak. Similar studies from other areas will be required to determine the fate of the American ZIKV outbreak. IMPORTANCE The ongoing American Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak involves millions of cases and has a major impact on maternal and child health. Knowledge of infection rates is crucial to project future epidemic patterns and determine the absolute risk of microcephaly upon maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy. For unknown reasons, the vast majority of ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases are concentrated in northeastern Brazil. We analyzed different subpopulations from Salvador, a Brazilian metropolis representing one of the most affected areas during the American ZIKV outbreak. We demonstrate rapid spread of ZIKV in Salvador, Brazil, and infection rates exceeding 60%. We provide evidence for the link between ZIKV and microcephaly, report that ZIKV predominantly affects geographic areas with low socioeconomic status, and show that population immunity likely caused cessation of the outbreak. Our results enable stakeholders to identify target populations for vaccination and for trials on vaccine efficacy and allow refocusing of research efforts and intervention strategies. Phenotypic Differences between Asian and African Lineage Zika Viruses in Human Neural Progenitor Cells ABSTRACT Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have been associated with a range of neurological complications, in particular congenital microcephaly. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of microcephaly, and experimental ZIKV infection of hNPCs has been shown to induce cell death. However, the infection efficiency and rate of cell death have varied between studies, which might be related to intrinsic differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains. Therefore, we determined the replication kinetics, including infection efficiency, burst size, and ability to induce cell death, of two Asian and two African ZIKV strains. African ZIKV strains replicated to higher titers in Vero cells, human glioblastoma (U87MG) cells, human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells, and hNPCs than Asian ZIKV strains. Furthermore, infection with Asian ZIKV strains did not result in significant cell death early after infection, whereas infection with African ZIKV strains resulted in high percentages of cell death in hNPCs. The differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains highlight the importance of including relevant ZIKV strains to study the pathogenesis of congenital microcephaly and caution against extrapolation of experimental data obtained using historical African ZIKV strains to the current outbreak. Finally, the fact that Asian ZIKV strains infect only a minority of cells with a relatively low burst size together with the lack of early cell death induction might contribute to its ability to cause chronic infections within the central nervous system (CNS).  IMPORTANCE The mechanism by which ZIKV causes a range of neurological complications, especially congenital microcephaly, is not well understood. The fact that congenital microcephaly is associated with Asian lineage ZIKV strains raises the question of why this was not discovered earlier. One possible explanation is that Asian and African ZIKV strains differ in their abilities to infect cells of the CNS and to cause neurodevelopmental problems. Here, we show that Asian ZIKV strains infect and induce cell death in human neural progenitor cells—which are important target cells in the development of congenital microcephaly—less efficiently than African ZIKV strains. These features of Asian ZIKV strains likely contribute to their ability to cause chronic infections, often observed in congenital microcephaly cases. It is therefore likely that phenotypic differences between ZIKV strains could be, at least in part, responsible for the ability of Asian ZIKV strains to cause congenital microcephaly. Enhanced Molecular Surveillance of Chikungunya Virus ABSTRACT Outbreaks of the emerging arbovirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) affect millions of individuals in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Vector competence can be changed dramatically by single amino acid exchanges located predominantly within the CHIKV E1 and E2 envelope proteins, which are associated with enhanced transmissibility by anthropophilic Aedes mosquitoes. Commonly used reference assays for molecular surveillance cover only a few adaptive mutations within the envelope domains and have not been validated for all CHIKV genotypes. The recognized landscape of CHIKV adaptive mutations is thus likely incomplete. We designed two nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays that cover hot spots of viral adaptation to vectors within the E1 and E2 genomic domains. Primers were designed in conserved genomic regions to allow broad usability across CHIKV genotypes. The sensitivity of both assays was at least equivalent to E1- and E2-based reference assays and robust among CHIKV genotypes at 51.4 IU/reaction (E1, 95% confidence interval [CI], 39.8 to 78.9) and 4.0 IU/reaction (E2, 95% CI, 2.0 to 7.4). Upon analysis of the complete known CHIKV genomic diversity, up to 11 nucleotide mismatches with CHIKV variants occurred under oligonucleotide binding sites of reference assays, potentially limiting assay sensitivity, whereas no critical mismatches occurred in the new assays. Specificity testing with nine alphaviruses representing all serocomplexes showed amplification of Mayaro virus and O\\'nyong-nyong virus by the E1-based assay, but not by the E2-based assay. The high sensitivity and specificity of the new E2-based assay may allow its diagnostic usage in resource-limited settings. The combined new assays allow improved molecular epidemiological surveillance of CHIKV globally. IMPORTANCE The life cycle of arboviruses relies on efficient infection of and transmission by arthropod vectors. Adaptation to new vectors can thus dramatically increase the geographic range of an arbovirus. Several adaptive mutations enhance chikungunya virus (CHIKV) transmissibility by different mosquito species. The appearance of those adaptive mutations has led to large-scale CHIKV outbreaks in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Molecular surveillance of circulating CHIKV strains for adaptive mutations contributes to precise risk assessments and efficient vector control and provides new insight into the evolution of vector adaptation. Existing assays for molecular CHIKV surveillance are limited by poor coverage of known adaptive mutations, low sensitivity, and cost-intensive deep sequencing approaches, preventing universal application. We developed two highly sensitive nested RT-PCR assays that cover hot spots of vector adaptation in CHIKV envelope domains. The new assays allow unprecedented molecular surveillance across all CHIKV genotypes and diagnostic use in resource-limited settings globally. Limited Evidence for Infection of Urban and Peri-urban Nonhuman Primates with Zika and Chikungunya Viruses in Brazil Since 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have infected millions of people in the Americas via urban transmission cycles. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are involved in sylvatic transmission cycles maintaining ZIKV and CHIKV in the Old World. We tested NHP sampled during 2012 to 2017 in urban and peri-urban areas severely affected by ZIKV and CHIKV in Brazil. Seroprevalence and antibody titers were low for both viruses. Additionally, we found evidence for infection by heterologous viruses eliciting cross-reactive antibodies. Our data suggest that urban or peri-urban NHP are not easily infected by ZIKV and CHIKV despite intense local transmission. These data may imply that the ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas cannot be sustained in urban or peri-urban NHP once human population immunity limits urban transmission cycles. Investigation of diverse animals is urgently required to determine the fate of the ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas. Evolution of shear fabric in granular fault gouge from stable sliding to stick slip and implications for fault slip mode Laboratory and theoretical studies provide insight into the mechanisms that control earthquake nucleation, when fault slip velocity is slow (<0.001 cm/s), and dynamic rupture when fault slip rates exceed centimeters per second. The application of these results to tectonic faults requires information about fabric evolution with shear and its impact on the mode of faulting. Here we report on laboratory experiments that illuminate the evolution of shear fabric and its role in controlling the transition from stable sliding ( v ∼0.001 cm/s) to dynamic stick slip ( v > 1 cm/s). The full range of fault slip modes was achieved by controlling the ratio K = k / k c , where k is the elastic loading stiffness and k c is the fault zone critical rheologic stiffness. We show that K controls the transition from slow-and-silent slip ( K > 0.9) to fast-and-audible ( K v = 3 cm/s, slip duration 0.003 s) slip events. Microstructural observations show that with accumulated strain, deformation concentrates in shear zones containing sharp shear planes made of nanoscale grains, which favor the development of frictional instabilities. Once this fabric is established, fault fabric does not change significantly with slip velocity, and fault slip behavior is mainly controlled by the interplay between the rheological properties of the slipping planes and fault zone stiffness. Are MRI-detected erosions specific for RA? A large explorative cross-sectional study OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended in the diagnostic process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to detect joint damage early. MRI-detected erosions are also present in symptom-free controls, especially at older age. It is unclear if RA-specific MRI-detected erosions can be distinguished from ‘physiological’ erosions in symptom-free individuals. This study compared MRI-detected erosions of RA-patients with healthy controls and with other arthritides. METHODS: 589 newly-presenting early arthritis patients (238 RA, 351 other arthritides) and 193 symptom-free controls underwent contrast-enhanced 1.5T MRI of unilateral metacarpophalangeal- and metatarsophalangeal(MTP)-joints. Total erosion score (according to RAMRIS), number, severity, location of erosions and simultaneous presence of MRI-detected inflammation (synovitis and/or bone marrow edema) were compared; participants were categorized in three age-groups (<40, 40-59, ≥60). RESULTS: RA-patients had statistically significant higher total erosion scores than controls but scores of individual persons largely overlapped. Grade ≥2 erosions and MTP5-erosions were specific for RA (specificity 98-100% and 90-98% for different age-groups). MTP1-erosions were only specific if aged<40 (specificity 98%) and erosions with inflammation if aged<60 (specificity 91-100%). ≥1 of the mentioned erosions characteristics were present in 29% of RA-patients. Comparing RA-patients with other arthritides revealed that grade ≥2 erosions and MTP5-erosions remained specific for RA (specificity ≥89%) as well as MTP1-erosions if aged<40 (specificity 93%), in contrast to erosions combined with inflammation (specificity 49-85%). CONCLUSIONS: Total erosion scores of individual persons were largely overlapping. Erosion characteristics specific for RA were identified, but were infrequently present. Caution is needed not to overestimate the value of MRI-erosions in the diagnostic process. Depression and anxiety associate with less remission after 1 year in rheumatoid arthritis Depression and anxiety have been considered to influence disease activity, and with great interest we read the recently published report by Michelsen et al .1 In this large, prospective, multicentre observational study, depression and anxiety reduced the likelihood of joint remission based on composite scores, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 3 and 6 months. Differences were predominantly caused by subjective markers of disease activity rather than by C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The study cannot prove causality; however, their findings imply that baseline depression/anxiety can impair the fulfilment of remission criteria during follow-up, influencing important treatment decisions. As replication is a keystone in research, we aimed to validate their findings in an independent cohort, the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC), to assess generalisability of the results. The EAC is a population-based inception cohort of patients with newly diagnosed arthritis that started in 1993; from 2010 onwards patients completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36) at … Early intensive treatment normalises excess mortality in ACPA-negative RA but not in ACPA-positive RA With great interest, we read the recently published report by Poppelaars et al in which no excess mortality was observed in 155 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the COmbinatie therapie Bij Rheumatoide Artritis (COBRA)-trial, who received early intensive treatment, compared with the general population (Standardised mortality rate (SMR) 0.80 (0.59–1.06)).1 The question whether mortality in RA has normalised is debated, as contradicting results have been published.2–8 In many of the studies on mortality, two important factors are not sufficiently taken into account: follow-up duration and disease subtypes. This might explain the conflicting results. Because thus far none of the reported studies incorporated both factors in the analyses, it is too soon to conclude that mortality is ‘normal’ again, as we will show here. We compliment the authors on emphasising the importance of a long follow-up duration by showing in their meta-analysis that excess mortality in RA becomes fully apparent after >10 years. This implies that previous studies that reported on normalisation of mortality had insufficient follow-up to reach this conclusion.2–5 Some studies with a short follow-up duration even showed a seemingly decreased … Systematic review of bariatric surgery liver biopsies clarifies the natural history of liver disease in patients with severe obesity Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent complication of morbid obesity, but its severity varies greatly and thus there is a strong need to better define its natural history in these patients. Design: Liver biopsies were systematically performed in 798 consecutive patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Histology was compared with clinical, biological, anthropometrical and body composition characteristics. Results: Patients with presumably normal liver (n=179, 22%) were significantly younger at bariatric surgery than patients with NAFLD (37.0 vs 44.4 years, p<0.0001). However, both groups showed quite similar obesity duration, since patients with presumably normal liver reported the onset of obesity at a significantly younger age than those with NAFLD (14.8 vs 20.0 year, p<0.0001). The trunk/limb fat mass ratio increased according to liver disease severity (presumably normal liver: 1.00, steatosis: 1.21, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): 1.34, p<0.0001), although the total body fat mass decreased (presumably normal liver: 50%, steatosis: 49.1%, NASH: 47.4%, p<0.0001). The volume of subcutaneous adipocytes increased according to severity of liver disease but only in female patients (presumably normal liver: 8543 picolitres, steatosis: 9156 picolitres, NASH: 9996 picolitres). Conclusions: These results suggest that young adults are more prone to store fat in subcutaneous tissue and reach the threshold of bariatric surgery indication before their liver is damaged. A shift of fat storage from subcutaneous to visceral adipose tissue compartment is associated with liver damages. Liver might also be targeted by subcutaneous hypertrophic adipocytes in females since hypertrophic adipocytes are more exposed to lipolysis and to the production of inflammatory mediators. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its relationship with cardiovascular disease and other extrahepatic diseases Key physiological functions of the liver, including glucose and lipid metabolism, become disturbed in the setting of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and may be associated with a systemic inflammatory \\'milieu\\' initiated in part by liver-secreted cytokines and molecules. Consequently, the pathophysiological effects of NAFLD extend beyond the liver with a large body of clinical evidence demonstrating NAFLD to be independently associated with both prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The magnitude of risk of developing these extrahepatic diseases parallels the underlying severity of NAFLD, such that patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) appear to be at greater risk of incident CVD, CKD and T2DM than those with simple steatosis. Other modifiers of risk may include genetic variants (eg, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 and trans-membrane 6 superfamily member 2 polymorphisms), visceral adipose tissue accumulation, dietary intake and the gut microbiome. Emerging data also suggest that NAFLD may be a risk factor for colonic neoplasia and reduced bone mineral density, especially among men. Importantly, improvement/resolution of NAFLD is associated with a reduced incidence of T2DM and improved kidney function, adding weight to causality and suggesting liver focused treatments may reduce risk of extrahepatic complications. Awareness of these associations is important for the clinicians such that CVD risk factor management, screening for T2DM and CKD are part of the routine management of patients with NAFLD. Comprehensive overview of the pharmacogenetic diversity in Ashkenazi Jews BackgroundAdverse drug reactions are a major concern in drug development and clinical therapy. Genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism and transport are major determinants of treatment efficacy and adverse reactions, and constitute important biomarkers for drug dosing, efficacy and safety. Importantly, human populations and subgroups differ substantially in their pharmacogenetic variability profiles, with important consequences for personalised medicine strategies and precision public health approaches. Despite their long migration history, Ashkenazi Jews constitute a rather isolated population with a unique genetic signature that is distinctly different from other populations. Objective To provide a comprehensive overview of the pharmacogenetic profile in Ashkenazim. Methods We analysed next-generation sequencing data from 5076 Ashkenazim individuals and used sequence data from 117\\u2009425 non-Jewish individuals as reference. Results We derived frequencies of 164 alleles in 17 clinically relevant pharmacogenes and derived profiles of putative functional consequences, providing the most comprehensive data set of Jewish pharmacogenetic diversity published to date. Furthermore, we detected 127 variants with an aggregated frequency of 20.7% that were specifically found in Ashkenazim, of which 55 variants were putatively deleterious (aggregated frequency of 9.4%). Conclusion The revealed pattern of pharmacogenetic variability in Ashkenazi Jews is distinctly different from other populations and is expected to translate into unique functional consequences, especially for the metabolism of CYP2A6, CYP2C9, NAT2 and VKORC1 substrates. We anticipate that the presented data will serve as a powerful resource for the guidance of pharmacogenetic treatment decisions and the optimisation of population-specific genotyping strategies in the Ashkenazi diaspora. Younger age of onset in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a result of pathogenic gene variants, rather than ascertainment bias Objective Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons with a median survival of 2 years. Familial ALS has a younger age of onset than apparently sporadic ALS. We sought to determine whether this younger age of onset is a result of ascertainment bias or has a genetic basis. Methods Samples from people with ALS were sequenced for 13 ALS genes. To determine the effect of genetic variation, age of onset was compared in people with sporadic ALS carrying a pathogenic gene variant and those who do not; to determine the effect of family history, we compared those with genetic sporadic ALS and familial ALS. Results There were 941 people with a diagnosis of ALS, 100 with familial ALS. Of 841 with apparently sporadic ALS, 95 carried a pathogenic gene variant. The mean age of onset in familial ALS was 5.3 years younger than for apparently sporadic ALS (p=6.0×10-5, 95%\\u2009CI 2.8 to 7.8 years). The mean age of onset of genetic sporadic ALS was 2.9 years younger than non-genetic sporadic ALS (p=0.011, 95%\\u2009CI 0.7 to 5.2 years). There was no difference between the mean age of onset in genetic sporadic ALS and familial ALS (p=0.097). Conclusions People with familial ALS have an age of onset about 5 years younger than those with apparently sporadic ALS, and we have shown that this is a result of Mendelian gene variants lowering the age of onset, rather than ascertainment bias. Retrotransposons in the development and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Endogenous retrotransposon sequences constitute approximately 42% of the human genome, and mobilisation of retrotransposons has resulted in rearrangements, duplications, deletions, novel transcripts and the introduction of new regulatory domains throughout the human genome. Both germline and somatic de novo retrotransposition events have been involved in a range of human diseases, and there is emerging evidence for the modulation of retrotransposon activity during the development of specific diseases. Particularly, there is unequivocal consensus that endogenous retrotransposition can occur in neuronal lineages. This review addresses our current knowledge of the different mechanisms through which retrotransposons might influence the development of and predisposition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Relative preservation of triceps over biceps strength in upper limb-onset ALS: the ‘split elbow’ Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor system. The split hand sign in ALS refers to observed preferential weakness of the lateral hand muscles, which is unexplained. One possibility is larger cortical representation of the lateral hand compared with the medial. Biceps strength is usually preserved relative to triceps in neurological conditions, but biceps has a larger cortical representation and might be expected to show preferential weakness in ALS. Methods: Using the South-East England Register for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, we performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study and extracted the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength score for biceps and triceps in patients with a diagnosis of upper limb-onset ALS in the 19-year period 1996-2015. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the relative strength of the muscles within the total sum of the upper limbs involved in the study. Results: There were 659 people with upper limb onset of weakness. In 215 there were insufficient data to perform the analysis, and a further 33 were excluded for other reasons, leaving 411 for analysis. Biceps was stronger than triceps in 87 limbs, and triceps was stronger than biceps in 258 limbs, with no difference seen in the remaining 477. Triceps strength scores (mean rank=186.1) were higher than ipsilateral biceps strength scores (mean rank=134.2), Z=-10.1, p<0.001 (two-tailed). Conclusion: Triceps strength is relatively preserved compared with biceps in ALS. This is consistent with a broadly corticofugal hypothesis of selective vulnerability, in which susceptibility might be associated with larger cortical representation. Agatston score of the descending aorta is independently associated with coronary events in a low-risk population Objectives A standard coronary artery calcium scan includes part of the aorta. This additional information is often not included in routine analyses. We aimed to determine the feasibility of assessing the Agatston score of the descending aorta calcification (DAC) on standard coronary calcium scans and the association of this score with coronary events in a low-risk study population. Methods Between January 2008 and March 2011, 390 consecutive patients who were referred for cardiac CT as part of work-up for pulmonary vein isolation (n=115) or assessment of presence of coronary artery disease (n=275) were included. At baseline, all patients were free of a history of cardiovascular disease. Two independent observers determined the Agatston score of the ascending aorta and descending aorta. Results A total of 16 patients (4.1%) developed coronary events (acute coronary syndrome (n=6) and symptomatic significant coronary artery disease requiring treatment (n=10)) during a follow-up of 67±12 months, with more events in patients with calcifications in the descending aorta than in those without (8.4% vs 3.7 %; p=0.08). Multivariable Cox regression, corrected for Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and coronary Agatston score (CAC), revealed that DAC was independently associated with coronary events (per 100 units; HR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09; p=0.001). DAC furthermore increased the identification of patients that will experience a coronary event (area under the curve: 0.68 for FRS only, 0.75 for FRS+CAC and 0.78 for FRS+CAC+DAC). Conclusions The Agatston score of the descending aorta could be included in the standard analysis of cardiac CT scans of low-risk patients since it holds valuable information for the prediction of coronary events. Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art Early initiation of treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis at risk of persistence and/or erosive progression is important because it is associated with a reduced rate of progression of joint damage and functional disability. It has been proposed that a window of opportunity exists, during which disease processes are less matured and disease modification can be more effective. The phase of arthralgia preceding clinical arthritis is likely to be an important part of this window of opportunity, during which treatment might prevent progression to clinical arthritis. Several proof-of-concept trials in individuals with arthralgia are now evaluating this hypothesis. Central to such trials is the ability to identify groups at high risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in whom preventive treatment can be tested. This review describes the relevance of adequate prediction making, as well as the accuracy of different types of predictors (including imaging and serological markers) with their value in predicting the progression of arthralgia to arthritis. Despite promising results, studies have been performed in heterogeneous patient populations and most findings have not been validated in independent studies. Future observational or preventive studies should be conducted with homogeneous patient groups (eg, patients fulfilling the European League Against Rheumatism criteria for arthralgia at risk of RA) in order to increase interstudy comparability and to allow result validation. Validity of the rheumatoid arthritis MRI score applied to the forefeet using the OMERACT filter: a systematic literature review ObjectiveMRI depicts inflammation and structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The validity of MRI-scoring of wrist-joints and metacarpophalangeal-joints according to the RA MRI score(RAMRIS) has been demonstrated. The Outcomes in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) RAMRIS Working Group recently called for validation of the RAMRIS of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP)-joints. Therefore, a systematic literature review was performed to test if the RAMRIS applied to the MTP-joints meets the OMERACT Filter of Truth, Discrimination and Feasibility.MethodsMedical literature databases up to January 2018 were systematically reviewed for studies reporting on RAMRIS applied to MRI of the MTP-joints in RA. To be included, an article had to contain at least one MRI-feature (synovitis, bone marrow oedema (BME), tenosynovitis, erosion, joint space narrowing (JSN)) and one item from the OMERACT Filter: Truth (face, content and construct validity), Discrimination (test-retest reliability, ability to discriminate in trials, longitudinal construct validity and thresholds of meaning) and Feasibility.ResultsOf the 749 retrieved studies, 13 were included, of which 9 provided data on construct validity, 4 on discrimination (3 on reliability, 2 on longitudinal construct validity and 1 on ability to discriminate in trials) and none on feasibility. Construct validity was suggested for BME and erosions, but lacking for synovitis, tenosynovitis and JSN. Data for discrimination remain to be developed for all outcomes.ConclusionAccording to the OMERACT Filter, the validity of the RAMRIS of the forefeet is insufficient in different aspects. A research agenda was determined. Window of opportunity in rheumatoid arthritis – definitions and supporting evidence: from old to new perspectives The therapeutic window of opportunity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often referred to. However, some have questioned whether such a period, in which the disease is more susceptible to disease-modifying treatment, really exists. Observational studies are most frequently referenced as supporting evidence, but results of such studies are subject to confounding. In addition formal consensus on the definition of the term has never been reached. We first reviewed the literature to establish if there is agreement on the concept of the window of opportunity in terms of its time period and the outcomes influenced. Second, a systemic literature search was performed on the evidence of the benefit of early versus delayed treatment as provided by randomised clinical trials. We observed that the concept of the window of opportunity has changed with respect to timing and outcome since its first description 25 years ago. There is an ‘old definition’ pointing to the first 2 years after diagnosis with increased potential for disease-modifying treatment to prevent severe radiographic damage and disability. Strong evidence supports this concept. A ‘new definition’ presumes a therapeutic window in a pre-RA phase in which the biologic processes could be halted and RA development prevented by very early treatment. This definition is not supported by evidence, although is less well studied in trials. Some suggestions for future research in this area are made. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Pathogenesis and Disease Spectrum Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the Western world and is increasing owing to its close association with obesity and insulin resistance. NAFLD represents a spectrum of liver disease that, in a minority of patients, can lead to progressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. NAFLD is a complex trait resulting from the interaction between environmental exposure and a susceptible polygenic background and comprising multiple independent modifiers of risk, such as the microbiome. The molecular mechanisms that combine to define the transition to NASH and progressive disease are complex, and consequently, no pharmacological therapy currently exists to treat NASH. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NAFLD is critical if new treatments are to be discovered. Pharmacoepigenetics and Toxicoepigenetics: Novel Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Opportunities Pharmacological treatment and exposure to xenobiotics can cause substantial changes in epigenetic signatures. he majority of these epigenetic changes, caused by the compounds in question, occur downstream of transcriptional activation mechanisms, whereby the epigenetic alterations can create a transcriptional memory and stably modulate cell function. The increasing understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and their importance in disease has prompted the development of therapeutic interventions that target epigenetic modulatory mechanisms, particularly in oncology where inhibitors of epigenetic-modifying proteins (epidrugs) have been successfully used in treatment, mostly in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy, either provoking direct cytotoxicity or inhibiting resistance to anticancer drugs. In addition, emerging methods for detecting epigenetically modified DNA in bodily fluids may provide information about tumor phenotype or drug treatment success. However, it is important to note that many technical pitfalls, such as the nondeconvolution of methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine, compromise epigenetic analyses and the interpretation of results. In this review, we provide an update on the field, with an emphasis on the novel therapeutic opportunities made possible by epidrugs. Vectors and Gene Delivery to the Retina International audience; One of the great advantages of the retina as a target tissue for gene delivery is the wide array of genetic tools that have been developed in the past decade. This includes a variety of vectors for therapeutic gene delivery to most types of retinal neurons and glia, as well as cell type–specific promoters for restricted gene expression in distinct neuronal subtypes. Within the scope of neuroscience applications and for gene therapy, it is now routine to express reporter genes, replacement genes, neuronal activity indicators, and microbial opsins in specific neuronal types in the mouse retina. However, there are considerable anatomical, physiological, immunological, and behavioral differences between the mouse and the human that limit the usefulness of these tools in humans and nonhuman primates. Several advances are now being made toward the goal of applying viral targeting tools to understand the primate retina. Here, we describe these advances, consider their potential to advance our understanding of the primate retina, and describe what will be needed to move forward. Cardiac MR Strain: A Noninvasive Biomarker of Fibrofatty Remodeling                    of the Left Atrial Myocardium Purpose To determine whether left atrial (LA) strain quantification with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging feature tracking is associated with the severity of LA fibrofatty myocardial remodeling at histologic analysis. Materials and Methods This prospective case-control study was approved by the institutional review board. LA strain was evaluated with cardiac MR feature tracking between January 2014 and March 2015 in 13 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years ± 19; nine male) with mitral regurgitation in the 24 hours before mitral valve surgery and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. LA strain parameters were compared first between control subjects and patients and then according to atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation status. Associations between LA strain and histology of preoperative biopsies were reported by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Spearman correlation. Results Peak longitudinal atrial strain (PLAS) was significantly lower in patients with mitral regurgitation than in healthy control subjects (P < .001). Increased LA remodeling was significantly related to altered LA strain, and the strongest association was found between PLAS and the degree of fibrofatty myocardial replacement at histologic analysis (r = -0.75, P = .017). LA end-diastolic volume was increased in patients with mitral regurgitation when compared with that in healthy volunteers (P < .001) because of volume overload; however, volume did not correlate with the histologic degree of LA fibrofatty replacement (r = -0.35, P = .330). Conclusion LA strain, especially PLAS, correlates strongly with the degree of fibrofatty replacement at histologic analysis. Such functional imaging biomarker in combination with LA volumetry could help to guide clinical decisions, since myocardial structural remodeling is a known morphologic substrate of LA dysfunction leading to atrial fibrillation with adverse outcome. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article. Quantification of Liver Fibrosis at T1 and T2 Mapping with Extracellular Volume Fraction MRI: Preclinical Results Purpose To evaluate MRI T1 and T2 mapping with calculation of extracellular volume (ECV) for diagnosis and grading of liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods Different grades of fibrosis were induced in 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats by bile duct ligation (BDL) and carbon-tetrachloride (CCl 4) intoxication. Portal pressure was measured invasively, whereas hepatic fibrosis was quantified by hydroxyproline content, Sirius red staining, and α smooth muscle actin staining. T1 values, T2 values, and ECV were assessed by using quantitative MRI mapping techniques. Results T1 values in animals 4 weeks after BDL were greater than in control animals (718 msec ± 74 vs 578 msec ± 33, respectively; P < .001). T2 values at 4 weeks were also greater in animals that underwent BDL than in control animals (46 msec ± 6 vs 29 msec ± 2, respectively; P < .001). Similar T1 and T2 findings were observed after CCl 4 intoxication. ECV was greater in animals 4 weeks after BDL compared with control animals (31.3% ± 1.3 vs 18.2% ± 3.5, respectively; P < .001), with similar results after CCl 4 intoxication. High correlations were found between ECV and hepatic hydroxyproline content (BDL: r = 0.68, P < .001; CCl 4: r = 0.65, P < .001), Sirius red staining (BDL: r = 0.88, P < .001; CCl 4: r = 0.82, P < .001), α smooth muscle actin staining (BDL: r = 0.70, P < .001; CCl 4: r = 0.73, P < .001), and portal pressure (BDL: r = 0.54, P = .003; CCl 4: r = 0.39, P = .043). Conclusion Elevation of T1 and T2 values and ECV was associated with severity of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension in an experimental animal model. Pgc1a is responsible for the sex differences in hepatic Cidec/Fsp27β mRNA expression in hepatic steatosis of mice fed a Western diet Hepatic fat-specific protein 27 [cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation effector protein C ( Cidec)/ Fsp27] mRNA levels have been associated with hepatic lipid droplet extent under certain circumstances. To address its hepatic expression under different dietary conditions and in both sexes, apolipoprotein E ( Apoe) -deficient mice were subjected to different experimental conditions for 11 wk to test the influence of cholesterol, Western diet, squalene, oleanolic acid, sex, and surgical castration on Cidec/Fsp27 mRNA expression. Dietary cholesterol increased hepatic Cidec/Fsp27β expression, an effect that was suppressed when cholesterol was combined with saturated fat as represented by Western diet feeding. Using the latter diet, neither oleanolic acid nor squalene modified its expression. Females showed lower levels of hepatic Cidec/Fsp27β expression than males when they were fed Western diets, a result that was translated into a lesser amount of CIDEC/FSP27 protein in lipid droplets and microsomes. This was also confirmed in low-density lipoprotein receptor ( Ldlr)-deficient mice. Incubation with estradiol resulted in decreased Cidec/Fsp27β expression in AML12 cells. Whereas male surgical castration did not modify the expression, ovariectomized females did show increased levels compared with control females. Females also showed increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α ( Pgc1a), suppressed by ovariectomy, and the values were significantly and inversely associated with those of Cidec/Fsp27β. When Pgc1a-deficient mice were used, the sex differences in Cidec/Fsp27β expression disappeared. Therefore, hepatic Cidec/Fsp27β expression has a complex regulation influenced by diet and sex hormonal milieu. The mRNA sex differences are controlled by Pgc1a. Assessment of liver fibrosis progression and regression by a serological collagen turnover profile There is a need for noninvasive biomarkers that can identify patients with progressive liver fibrosis and monitor response to antifibrotic therapy. An equally important need is identification of patients with spontaneous fibrosis regression, since they may not need treatment nor be included in clinical studies with fibrosis as end point. Circulating biomarkers, originating from defined fragments of the scar tissue itself, may serve as valuable tools for this aspect of precision medicine. We investigated a panel of serological collagen formation and degradation markers to identify patients likely to regress or progress in absence of a therapeutic intervention. Plasma samples from patients with moderate-stage hepatitis C receiving placebo treatment in a phase II trial of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist farglitazar were included. The patients had matched liver biopsies at baseline and 52 wk of follow-up. Serological biomarkers of collagen formation (PRO-C3, PRO-C4, PRO-C5) and collagen degradation (C3M, C4M, and C6M) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis including PRO-C3 and C6M identified subjects with progressive liver fibrosis with an AUROC of 0.91 ( P < 0.0001) and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) of 75.0%/88.6%. Low levels of PRO-C5 predicted a spontaneous regression phenotype, with an odds ratio of 33.8 times higher compared with patients with high levels ( P\\u2009< 0.0025) with an AUROC of 0.78 ( P < 0.0001) and PPV/NPV of 60.0%/95.7%. Two collagen fragments (PRO-C3 and C6M) identified liver fibrosis progressors, and one collagen fragment (PRO-C5) identified liver fibrosis regressors. These biomarkers may improve patient stratification and monitor treatment efficacy in studies with fibrosis as clinical end point. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study we report two biomarkers of collagen fragments (PRO-C3 and C6M) that are able to identify liver fibrosis progressors while one biomarker (PRO-C5) identified liver fibrosis regressors. In particular, we present three noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with progressive liver fibrosis, monitor response to antifibrotic therapy, and also identify the spontaneous liver fibrosis regression phenotype. Fibrogenesis assessed by serological type III collagen formation identifies patients with progressive liver fibrosis and responders to a potential antifibrotic therapy There are no approved treatments for liver fibrosis. To aid development of antifibrotic therapies, noninvasive biomarkers that can identify patients with progressive fibrosis and that permit monitoring of the response to antifibrotic therapy are much needed. Samples from a phase II antifibrotic trial of the glitazone farglitazar in patients with advanced hepatitis C, with matched follow-up liver biopsies, and from a phase III study of balaglitazone in patients with late-stage Type 2 diabetes (BALLET study) were analyzed for serological Pro-C3 levels in conjunction with other disease parameters. In the farglitazar study, a predefined cutoff value for Pro-C3 as a selection criterion led to the identification of subjects who 1) progressed by histological scores and 2) responded to therapy, as documented by attenuated fibrosis in liver biopsies. In the BALLET trial, subjects with the highest tertile of Pro-C3 levels responded to balaglitazone with reductions in levels of alanine aminotransferase and Pro-C3, as well as improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Elevated Pro-C3 levels are indicative of active fibrogenesis and structural progression of fibrosis, and it can potentially identify patients most likely to benefit from antimetabolic and antifibrotic treatments. Serum Pro-C3 may facilitate patient selection and could help to speed up antifibrotic drug development and validation. Combination of CCl4 with alcoholic and metabolic injuries mimics human liver fibrosis Metabolic and alcoholic liver injuries result in nonalcoholic (NAFLD) or alcoholic (ALD) fatty liver disease, respectively. In particular, presence of fibrosis in NAFLD and ALD requires treatment, but development of drugs is hampered by the lack of suitable models with significant fibrosis. The carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) liver fibrosis model does not reflect human NAFLD or ALD, but CCl4 may serve as a fibrosis accelerator in addition to another injury. Ethanol in drinking water (16%) or Western diet (WD) were administered for 7 wk in mice either alone or in combination with CCl4 intoxications. Extent of fibrosis, steatosis, and inflammation was assessed by histology, transcription, and biochemistry. Furthermore, transcription of fibrosis, proliferation, and inflammation-related genes was studied on human liver samples with fibrosis resulting from hepatitis C virus infection ( n = 7), NAFLD ( n = 8), or ALD ( n = 7). WD or ethanol alone induced only mild steatosis and inflammation. Combination of CCl4 and WD induced the most severe steatosis together with significant liver fibrosis and moderate inflammation. Combination of CCl4 and ethanol induced the strongest inflammation, with significant liver fibrosis and moderate steatosis. The relationship pattern between fibrosis, proliferation, and inflammation of human ALD was mostly similar in mice treated with CCl4 and ethanol. The combination of CCl4 intoxication with WD validates previous data suggesting it as an appropriate model for human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Especially, CCl4 plus ethanol for 7 wk induces ALD in mice, providing a model suitable for further basic research and drug testing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Alcoholic fatty liver disease with significant fibrosis is generated within 7 wk using carbon tetrachloride as a fibrosis accelerator and administering gradually ethanol (up to 16%) in mice. The similarity in the pattern of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis involved in alcoholic fatty liver disease to those of the human condition renders this mouse model suitable as a preclinical model for drug development. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation inhibits proarrhythmic alternans in postinfarction border zone cardiomyocytes: a computational analysis The border zone (BZ) of the viable myocardium adjacent to an infarct undergoes extensive autonomic and electrical remodeling and is prone to repolarization alternans-induced cardiac arrhythmias. BZ remodeling processes may promote or inhibit Ca2+ and/or repolarization alternans and may differentially affect ventricular arrhythmogenesis. Here, we used a detailed computational model of the canine ventricular cardiomyocyte to study the determinants of alternans in the BZ and their regulation by β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation. The BZ model developed Ca2+ transient alternans at slower pacing cycle lengths than the control model, suggesting that the BZ may promote spatially heterogeneous alternans formation in an infarcted heart. β-AR stimulation abolished alternans. By evaluating all combinations of downstream β-AR stimulation targets, we identified both direct (via ryanodine receptor channels) and indirect [via sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load] modulation of SR Ca2+ release as critical determinants of Ca2+ transient alternans. These findings were confirmed in a human ventricular cardiomyocyte model. Cell-to-cell coupling indirectly modulated the likelihood of alternans by affecting the action potential upstroke, reducing the trigger for SR Ca2+ release in one-dimensional strand simulations. However, β-AR stimulation inhibited alternans in both single and multicellular simulations. Taken together, these data highlight a potential antiarrhythmic role of sympathetic hyperinnervation in the BZ by reducing the likelihood of alternans and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling Ca2+ transient and repolarization alternans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We integrated, for the first time, postmyocardial infarction electrical and autonomic remodeling in a detailed, validated computer model of β-adrenergic stimulation in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Here, we show that β-adrenergic stimulation inhibits alternans and provide novel insights into underlying mechanisms, adding to a recent controversy about pro-/antiarrhythmic effects of postmyocardial infarction hyperinnervation.

From ionic to cellular variability in human atrial myocytes: an integrative computational and experimental study Variability refers to differences in physiological function between individuals, which may translate into different disease susceptibility and treatment efficacy. Experiments in human cardiomyocytes face wide variability and restricted tissue access; under these conditions, computational models are a useful complementary tool. We conducted a computational and experimental investigation in cardiomyocytes isolated from samples of the right atrial appendage of patients undergoing cardiac surgery to evaluate the impact of variability in action potentials (APs) and subcellular ionic densities on Ca2+ transient dynamics. Results showed that 1) variability in APs and ionic densities is large, even within an apparently homogenous patient cohort, and translates into\\u2009±100% variation in ionic conductances; 2) experimentally calibrated populations of models with wide variations in ionic densities yield APs overlapping with those obtained experimentally, even if AP characteristics of the original generic model differed significantly from experimental APs; 3) model calibration with AP recordings restricts the variability in ionic densities affecting upstroke and resting potential, but redundancy in repolarization currents admits substantial variability in ionic densities; and 4) model populations constrained with experimental APs and ionic densities exhibit three Ca2+ transient phenotypes, differing in intracellular Ca2+ handling and Na+/Ca2+ membrane extrusion. These findings advance our understanding of the impact of variability in human atrial electrophysiology. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Variability in human atrial electrophysiology is investigated by integrating for the first time cellular-level and ion channel recordings in computational electrophysiological models. Ion channel calibration restricts current densities but not cellular phenotypic variability. Reduced Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is identified as a primary mechanism underlying diastolic Ca2+ fluctuations in human atrial myocytes. Rho Kinase Inhibition by AT13148 Blocks Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarinoma Invasion and Tumor Growth The high mortality of pancreatic cancer demands that new therapeutic avenues be developed. The orally available small molecule inhibitor AT13148 potently inhibits ROCK1 and ROCK2 kinases that regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton. We previously reported that ROCK kinase expression increases with human and mouse pancreatic cancer progression and that conditional ROCK activation accelerates mortality in a genetically modified LSL-KrasG12D; LSL-p53R172H; Pdx1-Cre; (KPC) mouse pancreatic cancer model. In this study, we show that treatment of KPC mouse and human TKCC5 patient-derived pancreatic tumor cells with AT13148, as well as the ROCK selective inhibitors Y27632 and H1152, act comparably in blocking ROCK substrate phosphorylation. AT13148, Y27632, and H1152 induced morphological changes and reduced cellular contractile force generation, motility on pliable discontinuous substrates, and three-dimensional collagen matrix invasion. AT13148 treatment reduced subcutaneous tumor growth and blocked invasion of healthy pancreatic tissue by KPC tumor cells in vivo without affecting proliferation, suggesting a role for local tissue invasion as a contributor to primary tumor growth. These results suggest that AT13148 has anti-tumor properties that may be beneficial in combination therapies or in the adjuvant setting to reduce pancreatic cancer cell invasion and slow primary tumor growth. AT13148 might also have the additional benefit of enabling tumor resection by maintaining separation between tumor and healthy tissue boundaries. Increased Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Ubiquitin Carboxyl-Terminal Hydrolase L1 in Patients with Alzheimer\\'s Disease Background: Dysfunctions of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), including the highly abundant neuronal enzyme ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and autophagy-related changes (lysosomal degradation) are implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD). Method: This study evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of UCH-L1, protein deglycase (DJ-1), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 231 (P-tau231) in two independent patient and control cohorts. Cohort 1 included CSF samples from subjects having an AD biomarker profile (n = 10) or a control biomarker profile (n = 31), while cohort 2 was a monocenter clinical study including patients with AD (n = 32), mild cognitive impairment (n = 13), other dementias (n = 15), as well as cognitively healthy controls (n = 20). Results: UCH-L1 and P-tau231 were elevated in AD patients compared to controls in both cohorts. CSF levels of DJ-1 and NSE were unchanged in the AD group, whereas they were decreased in the group of other dementia compared to controls in the clinical study. Conclusion: Our main findings support that the UPS pathway may be impaired in AD, and UCH-L1 may serve as an additional CSF biomarker for AD. Exosomes: A Cancer Theranostics Road Map Abstract Interindividual variability is yet to be fully characterized, and for this, optimum patient stratification and companion diagnostics are still lacking. Especially when complex disease phenotypes and/or polygenic diseases are considered, patient monitoring and disease management become rather challenging, while acquired resistance to therapy and/or toxicity events are among the unmet needs in the clinic. No doubt, biomarkers are of great importance to disease management and tailor-made theranostics. Microfluidics has gathered great attention lately, mostly due to its low-invasive nature compared to tissue biopsies. Low invasiveness becomes greatly advantageous for microfluidics practices as the latter mirror cell biology revolutionizing cancer diagnostics and management. Recent advances in microfluidics hold the promise of robust clinical diagnostics after they have demonstrated effective exosome separation. We feel that microfluidics-based exosome isolation techniques, if cost-effective, could be implemented in the clinic and/or resource-scarce settings. This article (a) discusses exosomes, (b) comments on the first microfluidic advances in the field of cancer theranostics, (c) presents such advances in exosomes as complementary to liquid biopsies with an emphasis on circulating tumor cells, and (d) proposes a road map for future developments. Obesity/insulin resistance rather than liver fat increases coagulation factor activities and expression in humans SummaryIncreased liver fat may be caused by insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation or by the common I148M variant in PNPLA3 at rs738409, which lacks both of these features. We hypothesised that obesity/insulin resistance rather than liver fat increases circulating coagulation factor activities. We measured plasma prothrombin time (PT, Owren method), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), activities of several coagulation factors, VWF:RCo and fibrinogen, and D-dimer concentration in 92 subjects divided into groups based on insulin sensitivity [insulin-resistant (‘IR’) versus insulin-sensitive (‘IS’)] and PNPLA3 genotype (PNPLA3148MM/MI vs PNPLA3148II). Liver fat content (1H-MRS) was similarly increased in ‘IR’ (13 ± 1 %) and PNPLA3148MM/MI (12 ± 2 %) as compared to ‘IS’ (6 ± 1 %, p < 0.05) and PNPLA3148II (8 ± 1 %, p < 0.05), respectively. FVIII, FIX, FXIII, fibrinogen and VWF:RCo activities were increased, and PT and APTT shortened in ‘IR’ versus ‘IS’, in contrast to these factors being similar between PNPLA3148MM/MI and PNPLA3148II groups. In subjects undergoing a liver biopsy and entirely lacking the I148M variant, insulin-resistant subjects had higher hepatic expression of F8, F9 and FGG than equally obese insulin-sensitive subjects. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in adipose tissue correlated positively with PT (% of normal), circulating FVIII, FIX, FXI, VWR:RCo and fibrinogen, and expression of anti-inflammatory genes negatively with PT (%), FIX and fibrinogen. We conclude that obesity/insulin resistance rather than an increase in liver fat is associated with a procoagulant plasma profile. This reflects adipose tissue inflammation and increased hepatic production of coagulation factors and their susceptibility for activation.Supplementary Material to this article is available online at www.thrombosis-online.com. Atrial Fibrillation Complexity Parameters Derived From Surface ECGs Predict Procedural Outcome and Long-Term Follow-Up of Stepwise Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation Background— The success rate of catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is still far from satisfactory. Identification of patients who will benefit from ablation is highly desirable. We investigated the predictive value of noninvasive AF complexity parameters derived from standard 12-lead ECGs for AF termination and long-term success of catheter ablation and compared them with clinical predictors. Methods and Results— The study included a training (93 patients) and a validation set (81 patients) of patients with persistent AF undergoing stepwise radiofrequency ablation. In the training set AF terminated in 81% during catheter ablation, 77% were in sinus rhythm after 6 years and multiple ablations. ECG-derived complexity parameters were determined from a baseline 10-s 12-lead ECG. Prediction of AF termination was similar using only ECG (cross-validated mean area under the curve [AUC], 0.76±0.15) or only clinical parameters (mean AUC, 0.75±0.16). The combination improved prediction to a mean AUC of 0.79±0.13. Using a combined model of ECG and clinical parameters, sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up could be predicted with a mean AUC of 0.71±0.12. In the validation set AF terminated in 57%, 61% were in sinus rhythm after 4.6 years. The combined models predicted termination with an AUC of 0.70 and sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up with an AUC of 0.61. Overall, fibrillation-wave amplitude provided the best rhythm prediction. Conclusions— The predictive performance of ECG-derived AF complexity parameters for AF termination and long-term success of catheter ablation in patients with persistent AF is at least as good as known clinical predictive parameters, with fibrillation-wave amplitude as the best predictor. Rotors Detected by Phase Analysis of Filtered, Epicardial Atrial Fibrillation Electrograms Colocalize With Regions of Conduction Block Background Several recent studies suggest rotors detected by phase mapping may act as main drivers of persistent atrial fibrillation. However, the electrophysiological nature of detected rotors remains unclear. We performed a direct, 1:1 comparison between phase and activation time mapping in high-density, epicardial, direct-contact mapping files of human atrial fibrillation. Methods Thirty-eight unipolar electrogram files of 10 s duration were recorded in patients with atrial fibrillation (n=20 patients) using a 16×16 electrode array placed on the epicardial surface of the left atrial posterior wall or the right atrial free wall. Phase maps and isochrone wave maps were constructed for all recordings. For each detected phase singularity (PS) with a lifespan of >1 cycle length, the corresponding conduction pattern was investigated in the isochrone wave maps. Results When using sinusoidal recomposition and Hilbert Transform, 138 PSs were detected. One hundred and four out of 138 PSs were detected within 1 electrode distance (1.5 mm) from a line of conduction block between nonrotating wavefronts detected by activation mapping. Far fewer rotating wavefronts were detected when rotating activity was identified based on wave mapping (18 out of 8219 detected waves). Fourteen out of these 18 cases were detected as PSs in phase mapping. Phase analysis of filtered electrograms produced by simulated wavefronts separated by conduction block also identified PSs on the line of conduction block. Conclusions PSs identified by phase analysis of filtered epicardial electrograms colocalize with conduction block lines identified by activation mapping. Detection of PSs using phase analysis has a low specificity for identifying rotating wavefronts during human atrial fibrillation using activation mapping. Genotype-Based Recall Studies in Complex Cardiometabolic Traits In genotype-based recall (GBR) studies, people (or their biological samples) who carry genotypes of special interest for a given hypothesis test are recalled from a larger cohort (or biobank) for more detailed investigations. There are several GBR study designs that offer a range of powerful options to elucidate (1) genotype-phenotype associations (by increasing the efficiency of genetic association studies, thereby allowing bespoke phenotyping in relatively small cohorts), (2) the effects of environmental exposures (within the Mendelian randomization framework), and (3) gene-treatment interactions (within the setting of GBR interventional trials). In this review, we overview the literature on GBR studies as applied to cardiometabolic health outcomes. We also review the GBR approaches used to date and outline new methods and study designs that might enhance the utility of GBR-focused studies. Specifically, we highlight how GBR methods have the potential to augment randomized controlled trials, providing an alternative application for the now increasingly accepted Mendelian randomization methods usually applied to large-scale population-based data sets. Further to this, we consider how functional and basic science approaches alongside GBR designs offer intellectually intriguing and potentially powerful ways to explore the implications of alterations to specific (and potentially druggable) biological pathways. Complex Congenital Heart Disease Associated With Disordered Myocardial Architecture in a Midtrimester Human Fetus [Background]: In the era of increasingly successful corrective interventions in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), global and regional myocardial remodeling are emerging as important sources of long-term morbidity/mortality. Changes in organization of the myocardium in CHD, and in its mechanical properties, conduction, and blood supply, result in altered myocardial function both before and after surgery. To gain a better understanding and develop appropriate and individualized treatment strategies, the microscopic organization of cardiomyocytes, and their integration at a macroscopic level, needs to be completely understood. The aim of this study is to describe, for the first time, in 3 dimensions and nondestructively the detailed remodeling of cardiac microstructure present in a human fetal heart with complex CHD. [Methods and results]: Synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging was used to image an archival midgestation formalin-fixed fetal heart with right isomerism and complex CHD and compare with a control fetal heart. Analysis of myocyte aggregates, at detail not accessible with other techniques, was performed. Macroanatomic and conduction system changes specific to the disease were clearly observable, together with disordered myocyte organization in the morphologically right ventricle myocardium. Electrical activation simulations suggested altered synchronicity of the morphologically right ventricle. [Conclusions]: We have shown the potential of X-ray phase-contrast imaging for studying cardiac microstructure in the developing human fetal heart at high resolution providing novel insight while preserving valuable archival material for future study. This is the first study to show myocardial alterations occur in complex CHD as early as midgestation. Vitamin K–Dependent Matrix Gla Protein as Multifaceted Protector of Vascular and Tissue Integrity ispartof: HYPERTENSION vol:73 issue:6 pages:1160-1169 ispartof: location:United States status: published Bicycling to Work and Primordial Prevention of Cardiovascular Risk: A Cohort Study Among Swedish Men and Women BACKGROUND: Bicycling to work may be a viable approach for achieving physical activity that provides cardiovascular health benefits. In this study we investigated the relationship of bicycling to work with incidence of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance across a decade of follow-up in middle-aged men and women.METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 23 732 Swedish men and women with a mean age of 43.5 years at baseline who attended a health examination twice during a 10-year period (1990-2011). In multivariable adjusted models we calculated the odds of incident obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance, comparing individuals who commuted to work by bicycle with those who used passive modes of transportation. We also examined the relationship of change in commuting mode with incidence of these clinical risk factors. Cycling to work at baseline was associated with lower odds of incident obesity (odds ratio [OR]=0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99), hypertension (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.95), hypertriglyceridemia (OR=0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94), and impaired glucose tolerance (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96) compared with passive travel after adjusting for putative confounding factors. Participants who maintained or began bicycling to work during follow-up had lower odds of obesity (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.73), hypertension (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98), hypertriglyceridemia (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.90), and impaired glucose tolerance (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91) compared with participants not cycling to work at both times points or who switched from cycling to other modes of transport during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that commuting by bicycle to work is an important strategy for primordial prevention of clinical cardiovascular risk factors among middle-aged men and women. Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Relation to Environmental Exposure to Lead and Cadmium Background-Experimental studies have demonstrated that lead and cadmium have direct toxic effects on the myocardium, but the few human studies are limited by design, assessment of exposure, and use of heart failure as a late-stage endpoint. Methods and Results-In a prospective population study, we studied the association of left ventricular (LV) function with blood lead (BPb) and 24-hour urinary cadmium (UCd). In 179 participants randomly recruited from a Flemish population (50.3% women; mean age 39.1 years), geometric mean BPb and UCd at enrollment (1985-2000) were 0.20 mu mol/L and 6.1 nmol, respectively. We assessed systolic and diastolic LV function 11.9 years (median) later (2005-2010) by using Doppler imaging of the transmitral blood flow and the mitral annular movement and speckle tracking. In multivariable-adjusted linear regression, LV systolic function decreased with BPb. For a doubling of exposure, estimates were -0.392% for global longitudinal strain (P=0.034), -0.618% and -0.113 s (1) for regional longitudinal strain (P=0.028)and strain rate (P=0.008), and -0.056 s (1) for regional radial strain rate (P=0.050). Regional longitudinal strain rate (-0.066 s (1), P=0.009)and regional radial strain (-2.848%, P=0.015) also decreased with UCd. Models including both exposure indexes did not allow differentiating whether LV dysfunction was predominately related to BPb or UCd. Diastolic LV function was not associated with BPb or UCd (P=0.159). Conclusions-Although effect sizes were small, our results suggest that environmental exposure to lead, cadmium, or both might be a risk factor for systolic LV dysfunction, a condition often proceeding to heart failure. European Union [HEALTH-FP7-278249-EUMAS-CARA, HEALTH-F7-305507 HOMAGE]; European Union (European Research Council) [2011-294713-EPLORE]; European Union (Proof-of-Concept Grant) [713601-uPRO-PHET]; Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen, Ministry of the Flemish Community, Brussels, Belgium [G.0881.13, G.0880.13] Novel Urinary Peptidomic Classifier Predicts Incident Heart Failure Background: Detection of preclinical cardiac dysfunction and prognosis of left ventricular heart failure (HF) would allow targeted intervention, and appears to be the most promising approach in its management. Novel biomarker panels may support this approach and provide new insights into the pathophysiology.\\\\ud \\\\ud Methods and Results: A retrospective comparison of urinary proteomic profiles generated by mass spectrometric analysis from 49 HF patients, 36 patients who progressed to HF within 2.6±1.6 years, and 192 sex‐ and age‐matched controls who did not progress to HF enabled identification of 96 potentially HF‐specific peptide biomarkers. Based on these 96 peptides, the classifier called Heart Failure Predictor (HFP) was established by support vector machine modeling. The incremental prognostic value of HFP was subsequently evaluated in urine samples from 175 individuals with asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction from an independent population cohort. Within 4.8 years, 17 of these individuals progressed to overt HF. The area under receiver‐operating characteristic curve was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56–0.82); P=0.0047 for HFP and 0.57 (0.42–0.72; P=0.62) for N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide. Hazard ratios were 1.63 (CI, 1.04–2.55; P=0.032) per 1‐SD increment in HFP and 0.70 (CI, 0.35–1.41; P=0.32) for a doubling of the logarithmically transformed N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide.\\\\ud \\\\ud Conclusions: HFP is a novel biomarker derived from the urinary proteome and might serve as a sensitive tool to improve risk stratification, patient management, and understanding of the pathophysiology of HF. Myocardial Perfusion Is Impaired and Relates to Cardiac Dysfunction in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Both Before and After Successful Catheter Ablation Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with myocardial infarction, and patients with AF and no obstructive coronary artery disease can present with symptoms and evidence of cardiac ischemia. We hypothesized that microvascular coronary dysfunction underlies these observations. Methods and Results Myocardial blood flow (MBF) at baseline and during adenosine stress and left ventricular and left atrial function were evaluated by magnetic resonance in 49 patients with AF (25 paroxysmal, 24 persistent) with no history of epicardial coronary artery disease or diabetes mellitus, before and 6 to 9 months after ablation. Findings were compared with those obtained in matched controls in sinus rhythm (n=25). Before ablation, patients with AF had impaired left atrial function and left ventricular ejection fraction and strain indices (all P<0.05 versus controls). MBF was impaired in patients both under baseline conditions (1.21±0.24 mL/min per g·[mm Hg·bpm/104]−1 versus 1.34±0.28 mL/min per g·[mm Hg·bpm/104]−1 in controls, P=0.044) and during adenosine stress (2.29±0.48 mL/min per g versus 2.73±0.37 mL/min per g in controls, P<0.001). Under baseline conditions, MBF correlated with left ventricular strain and left atrial function (all P≤0.001), so that cardiac function was most impaired in patients with the lowest MBF. Baseline and stress MBF remained unchanged postablation (both P=ns), and baseline MBF showed similar correlations with functional indices to those present preablation (all P≤0.001). Conclusions Baseline and stress MBF are significantly impaired in patients with AF but no epicardial coronary artery disease. Reduction in MBF is proportional to severity of left ventricular and left atrial dysfunction, even after successful ablation. Coronary microvascular dysfunction may be a relevant pathophysiological mechanism in patients with a history of AF. Circulating Biomarkers Predicting Longitudinal Changes in Left Ventricular Structure and Function in a General Population Background Serial imaging studies in the general population remain important to evaluate the usefulness of pathophysiologically relevant biomarkers in predicting progression of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction. Here, we assessed in a general population whether these circulating biomarkers at baseline predict longitudinal changes in LV structure and function. Methods and Results In 592 participants (mean age, 50.8\\xa0years; 51.4% women; 40.5% hypertensive), we derived echocardiographic indexes reflecting LV structure and function at baseline and after 4.7\\xa0years. At baseline, we measured alkaline phosphatase, markers of collagen turnover (procollagen type I, C-terminal telopeptide, matrix metalloproteinase-1) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T. We regressed longitudinal changes in LV indexes on baseline biomarker levels and reported standardized effect sizes as a fraction of the standard deviation of LV change. After full adjustment, a decline in LV longitudinal strain (-14.2%) and increase in E/e\\' ratio over time (+18.9%; P≤0.019) was associated with higher alkaline phosphatase activity at baseline. Furthermore, longitudinal strain decreased with higher levels of collagen I production and degradation at baseline (procollagen type I, -14.2%; C-terminal telopeptide, -16.4%; P≤0.029). An increase in E/e\\' ratio over time was borderline associated with lower matrix metalloproteinase-1 (+9.8%) and lower matrix metalloproteinase-1/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ratio (+11.9%; P≤0.041). Higher high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels at baseline correlated significantly with an increase in relative wall thickness (+23.1%) and LV mass index (+18.3%) during follow-up ( P≤0.035). Conclusions We identified a set of biomarkers predicting adverse changes in LV structure and function over time. Circulating biomarkers reflecting LV stiffness, injury, and collagen composition might improve the identification of subjects at risk for subclinical cardiac maladaptation. ispartof: JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION vol:8 issue:2 ispartof: location:England status: published Noninvasive gene delivery to foveal cones for vision restoration International audience; Intraocular injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has been an evident route for delivering gene drugs into the retina. However, gaps in our understanding of AAV transduction patterns within the anatomically unique environments of the subretinal and intravitreal space of the primate eye impeded the establishment of noninvasive and efficient gene delivery to foveal cones in the clinic. Here, we establish new vector-promoter combinations to overcome the limitations associated with AAV-mediated cone transduction in the fovea with supporting studies in mouse models, human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived organoids, postmortem human retinal explants, and living macaques. We show that an AAV9 variant provides efficient foveal cone transduction when injected into the subretinal space several millimeters away from the fovea, without detaching this delicate region. An engineered AAV2 variant provides gene delivery to foveal cones with a well-tolerated dose administered intravitreally. Both delivery modalities rely on a cone-specific promoter and result in high-level transgene expression compatible with optogenetic vision restoration. The model systems described here provide insight into the behavior of AAV vectors across species to obtain safety and efficacy needed for gene therapy in neurodegenerative disorders. The Benefits of Global High Resolution for Climate Simulation: Process Understanding and the Enabling of Stakeholder Decisions at the Regional Scale A perspective on current and future capabilities in global high-resolution climate simulation for assessing climate risks over next few decades, including advances in process representation and analysis, justifying the emergence of dedicated, coordinated experimental protocols.\\\\ud \\\\ud \\\\ud The timescales of the Paris Climate Agreement indicate urgent action is required on climate policies over the next few decades, in order to avoid the worst risks posed by climate change. On these relatively short timescales the combined effect of climate variability and change are both key drivers of extreme events, with decadal timescales also important for infrastructure planning. Hence, in order to assess climate risk on such timescales, we require climate models to be able to represent key aspects of both internally driven climate variability, as well as the response to changing forcings.\\\\ud \\\\ud In this paper we argue that we now have the modelling capability to address these requirements - specifically with global models having horizontal resolutions considerably enhanced from those typically used in previous IPCC and CMIP exercises. The improved representation of weather and climate processes in such models underpins our enhanced confidence in predictions and projections, as well as providing improved forcing to regional models, which are better able to represent local-scale extremes (such as convective precipitation). We choose the global water cycle as an illustrative example, because it is governed by a chain of processes for which there is growing evidence of the benefits of higher resolution. At the same time it comprises key processes involved in many of the expected future climate extremes (e.g. flooding, drought, tropical and mid-latitude storms). Extratropical–Tropical Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (Etin-Mip): Protocol and Initial Results This article introduces the Extratropical–Tropical Interaction Model Intercomparison Project (ETIN-MIP), where a set of fully coupled model experiments are designed to examine the sources of longstanding tropical precipitation biases in climate models. In particular, we reduce insolation over three targeted latitudinal bands of persistent model biases: the southern extratropics, the southern tropics, and the northern extratropics. To address the effect of regional energy bias corrections on the mean distribution of tropical precipitation, such as the double intertropical convergence zone problem, we evaluate the quasi-equilibrium response of the climate system corresponding to a 50-yr period after the 100 years of prescribed energy perturbation. Initial results show that, despite a large intermodel spread in each perturbation experiment due to differences in ocean heat uptake response and climate feedbacks across models, the southern tropics is most efficient at driving a meridional shift of tropical precipitation. In contrast, the extratropical energy perturbations are effectively damped by anomalous heat uptake over the subpolar oceans, thereby inducing a smaller meridional shift of tropical precipitation compared with the tropical energy perturbations. The ETIN-MIP experiments allow us to investigate the global implications of regional energy bias corrections, providing a route to guide the practice of model development, with implications for understanding dynamical responses to anthropogenic climate change and geoengineering. Unlocking Pre-1850 Instrumental Meteorological Records: A Global Inventory Instrumental meteorological measurements from periods prior to the start of national weather services are designated “early instrumental data.” They have played an important role in climate research as they allow daily to decadal variability and changes of temperature, pressure, and precipitation, including extremes, to be addressed. Early instrumental data can also help place twenty-first century climatic changes into a historical context such as defining preindustrial climate and its variability. Until recently, the focus was on long, high-quality series, while the large number of shorter series (which together also cover long periods) received little to no attention. The shift in climate and climate impact research from mean climate characteristics toward weather variability and extremes, as well as the success of historical reanalyses that make use of short series, generates a need for locating and exploring further early instrumental measurements. However, information on early instrumental series has never been electronically compiled on a global scale. Here we attempt a worldwide compilation of metadata on early instrumental meteorological records prior to 1850 (1890 for Africa and the Arctic). Our global inventory comprises information on several thousand records, about half of which have not yet been digitized (not even as monthly means), and only approximately 20% of which have made it to global repositories. The inventory will help to prioritize data rescue efforts and can be used to analyze the potential feasibility of historical weather data products. The inventory will be maintained as a living document and is a first, critical, step toward the systematic rescue and reevaluation of these highly valuable early records. Additions to the inventory are welcome. LongRunMIP: Motivation and Design for a Large Collection of Millennial-Length AOGCM Simulations We present a model intercomparison project, LongRunMIP, the first collection of millennial-length (1,000+ years) simulations of complex coupled climate models with a representation of ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, and land surface, and their interactions. Standard model simulations are generally only a few hundred years long. However, modeling the long-term equilibration in response to radiative forcing perturbation is important for understanding many climate phenomena, such as the evolution of ocean circulation, time- and temperature-dependent feedbacks, and the differentiation of forced signal and internal variability. The aim of LongRunMIP is to facilitate research into these questions by serving as an archive for simulations that capture as much of this equilibration as possible. The only requirement to participate in LongRunMIP is to contribute a simulation with elevated, constant CO2 forcing that lasts at least 1,000 years. LongRunMIP is an MIP of opportunity in that the simulations were mostly performed prior to the conception of the archive without an agreed-upon set of experiments. For most models, the archive contains a preindustrial control simulation and simulations with an idealized (typically abrupt) CO2 forcing. We collect 2D surface and top-of-atmosphere fields and 3D ocean temperature and salinity fields. Here, we document the collection of simulations and discuss initial results, including the evolution of surface and deep ocean temperature and cloud radiative effects. As of October 2019, the collection includes 50 simulations of 15 models by 10 modeling centers. The data of LongRunMIP are publicly available. We encourage submissions of more simulations in the future. How Well Can We Represent the Spectrum of Convective Clouds in a Climate Model? Comparisons between Internal Parameterization Variables and Radar Observations Current climate models cannot resolve individual convective clouds, and hence parameterizations are needed. The primary goal of convective parameterization is to represent the bulk impact of convection on the gridbox-scale variables. Spectral convective parameterizations also aim to represent the key features of the subgrid-scale convective cloud field such as cloud-top-height distribution and in-cloud vertical velocities in addition to precipitation rates. Ground-based radar retrievals of these quantities have been made available at Darwin, Australia, permitting direct comparisons of internal parameterization variables and providing new observational references for further model development. A spectral convective parameterization [the convective cloud field model (CCFM)] is discussed, and its internal equation of motion is improved. Results from the ECHAM–HAM model in single-column mode using the CCFM and the bulk mass flux Tiedtke–Nordeng scheme are compared with the radar retrievals at Darwin. The CCFM is found to outperform the Tiedtke–Nordeng scheme for cloud-top-height and precipitation-rate distributions. Radar observations are further used to propose a modified CCFM configuration with an aerodynamic drag and reduced entrainment parameter, further improving both the convective cloud-top-height distribution (important for large-scale impact of convection) and the in-cloud vertical velocities (important for aerosol activation). This study provides a new development in the CCFM, improving the representation of convective cloud spectrum characteristics observed in Darwin. This is a step toward an improved representation of convection and ultimately of aerosol effects on convection. It also shows how long-term radar observations of convective cloud properties can help constrain parameters of convective parameterization schemes. The Resolution Sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere Blocking in Four 25-km Atmospheric Global Circulation Models The aim of this study is to investigate if the representation of Northern Hemisphere blocking is sensitive to resolution in current-generation atmospheric global circulation models (AGCMs). An evaluation is conducted of how well atmospheric blocking is represented in four AGCMs whose horizontal resolution is increased from a grid spacing of more than 100 km to about 25 km. It is shown that Euro-Atlantic blocking is simulated overall more credibly at higher resolution (i.e., in better agreement with a 50-yr reference blocking climatology created from the reanalyses ERA-40 and ERA-Interim). The improvement seen with resolution depends on the season and to some extent on the model considered. Euro-Atlantic blocking is simulated more realistically at higher resolution in winter, spring, and autumn, and robustly so across the model ensemble. The improvement in spring is larger than that in winter and autumn. Summer blocking is found to be better simulated at higher resolution by one model only, with little change seen in the other three models. The representation of Pacific blocking is not found to systematically depend on resolution. Despite the improvements seen with resolution, the 25-km models still exhibit large biases in Euro-Atlantic blocking. For example, three of the four 25-km models underestimate winter northern European blocking frequency by about one-third. The resolution sensitivity and biases in the simulated blocking are shown to be in part associated with the mean-state biases in the models’ midlatitude circulation. Benefits of Increasing the Model Resolution for the Seasonal Forecast Quality in EC-Earth Resolution in climate models is thought to be an important factor for advancing seasonal prediction capability. To test this hypothesis, seasonal ensemble reforecasts are conducted over 1993–2009 with the European community model EC-Earth in three configurations: standard resolution (~1° and ~60 km in the ocean and atmosphere models, respectively), intermediate resolution (~0.25° and ~60 km), and high resolution (~0.25° and ~39 km), the two latter configurations being used without any specific tuning. The model systematic biases of 2-m temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed are generally reduced. Notably, the tropical Pacific cold tongue bias is significantly reduced, the Somali upwelling is better represented, and excessive precipitation over the Indian Ocean and over the Maritime Continent is decreased. In terms of skill, tropical SSTs and precipitation are better reforecasted in the Pacific and the Indian Oceans at higher resolutions. In particular, the Indian monsoon is better predicted. Improvements are more difficult to detect at middle and high latitudes. Still, a slight improvement is found in the prediction of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) along with a more realistic representation of atmospheric blocking. The sea ice extent bias is unchanged, but the skill of the reforecasts increases in some cases, such as in summer for the pan-Arctic sea ice. All these results emphasize the idea that the resolution increase is an essential feature for forecast system development. At the same time, resolution alone cannot tackle all the forecast system deficiencies and will have to be implemented alongside new physical improvements to significantly push the boundaries of seasonal prediction. Tropical Cyclone Interaction with the Ocean: The Role of High-Frequency (Subdaily) Coupled Processes Through tropical cyclone (TC) activity the ocean and the atmosphere exchange a large amount of energy. In this work possible improvements introduced by a higher coupling frequency are tested between the two components of a climate model in the representation of TC intensity and TC–ocean feedbacks. The analysis is based on the new Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per I Cambiamenti Climatici Climate Model (CMCC-CM2-VHR), capable of representing realistic TCs up to category-5 storms. A significant role of the negative sea surface temperature (SST) feedback, leading to a weakening of the cyclone intensity, is made apparent by the improved representation of high-frequency coupled processes. The first part of this study demonstrates that a more realistic representation of strong TC count is obtained by coupling atmosphere and ocean components at hourly instead of daily frequency. Coherently, the positive bias of the annually averaged power dissipation index associated with TCs is reduced by one order of magnitude when coupling at the hourly frequency, compared to both forced mode and daily coupling frequency results. The second part of this work shows a case study (a modeled category-5 typhoon) analysis to verify the impact of a more realistic representation of the high-frequency coupling in representing the TC effect on the ocean; the theoretical subsurface warming induced by TCs is well represented when coupling the two components at the higher frequency. This work demonstrates that an increased horizontal resolution of model components is not sufficient to ensure a realistic representation of intense and fast-moving systems, such as tropical and extratropical cyclones, but a concurrent increase in coupling frequency is required. Nonstationarity in Southern Hemisphere Climate Variability Associated with the Seasonal Breakdown of the Stratospheric Polar Vortex Statistical models of climate generally regard climate variability as anomalies about a climatological seasonal cycle, which are treated as a stationary stochastic process plus a long-term seasonally dependent trend. However, the climate system has deterministic aspects apart from the climatological seasonal cycle and long-term trends, and the assumption of stationary statistics is only an approximation. The variability of the Southern Hemisphere zonal-mean circulation in the period encompassing late spring and summer is an important climate phenomenon and has been the subject of numerous studies. It is shown here, using reanalysis data, that this variability is rendered highly nonstationary by the organizing influence of the seasonal breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex, which breaks time symmetry. It is argued that the zonal-mean tropospheric circulation variability during this period is best viewed as interannual variability in the transition between the springtime and summertime regimes induced by variability in the vortex breakdown. In particular, the apparent long-term poleward jet shift during the early-summer season can be more simply understood as a delay in the equatorward shift associated with this regime transition. The implications of such a perspective for various open questions are discussed. Intraseasonal Effects of El Niño–Southern Oscillation on North Atlantic Climate It is well established that El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts the North Atlantic–European (NAE) climate, with the strongest influence in winter. In late winter, the ENSO signal travels via both tropospheric and stratospheric pathways to the NAE sector and often projects onto the North Atlantic Oscillation. However, this signal does not strengthen gradually during winter, and some studies have suggested that the ENSO signal is different between early and late winter and that the teleconnections involved in the early winter subperiod are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the ENSO teleconnection to NAE in early winter (November–December) and characterize the possible mechanisms involved in that teleconnection. To do so, observations, reanalysis data and the output of different types of model simulations have been used. We show that the intraseasonal winter shift of the NAE response to ENSO is detected for both El Niño and La Niña and is significant in both observations and initialized predictions, but it is not reproduced by free-running Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The teleconnection is established through the troposphere in early winter and is related to ENSO effects over the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea that appear in rainfall and reach the NAE region. CMIP5 model biases in equatorial Pacific ENSO sea surface temperature patterns and strength appear to explain the lack of signal in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea and, hence, their inability to reproduce the intraseasonal shift of the ENSO signal over Europe. Eddy Activity Response to Global Warming–Like Temperature Changes Global warming projections show an anomalous temperature increase both at the Arctic surface and at lower latitudes in the upper troposphere. The Arctic amplification decreases the meridional temperature gradient, and simultaneously decreases static stability. These changes in the meridional temperature gradient and in the static stability have opposing effects on baroclinicity. The temperature increase at the upper tropospheric lower latitudes tends to increase the meridional temperature gradient and simultaneously increase static stability, which have opposing effects on baroclinicity as well. In this study, a dry idealized general circulation model with a modified Newtonian cooling scheme, which allows any chosen zonally symmetric temperature distribution to be simulated, is used to study the effect of Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming on eddy activity. Due to the interplay between the static stability and meridional temperature gradient on atmospheric baroclinicity changes, and their opposing effect on atmospheric baroclinicity, it is found that both the Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming could potentially lead to both decreases and increases in eddy activity, depending on the exact prescribed temperature modifications. Therefore, to understand the effect of global warming–like temperature trends on eddy activity, the zonally symmetric global warming temperature projections from state-of-the-art models are simulated. It is found that the eddy kinetic energy changes are dominated by the lower-latitude upper-level warming, which tends to weaken the eddy kinetic energy due to increased static stability. On the other hand, the eddy heat flux changes are dominated by the Arctic amplification, which tends to weaken the eddy heat flux at the lower levels. Impact of CYP2C19 Genotype on Escitalopram Exposure and Therapeutic Failure: A Retrospective Study Based on 2,087 Patients Objective: The antidepressant escitalopram is predominantly metabolized by the polymorphic CYP2C19 enzyme. The authors investigated the effect of CYP2C19 genotype on exposure and therapeutic failure of escitalopram in a large patient population. Method: A total of 4,228 escitalopram serum concentration measurements from 2,087 CYP2C19-genotyped patients 10-30 hours after drug intake were collected retrospectively from the drug monitoring database at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo. The patients were divided into subgroups based on CYP2C19 genotype: those carrying inactive (CYP2C19Null) and gain-of-function (CYP2C19*17) variant alleles. The between-subgroup differences in escitalopram exposure (endpoint: dose-harmonized serum concentration) and therapeutic failure (endpoint: switching to another antidepressant within 1 year after the last escitalopram measurement) were evaluated by multivariate mixed model and chi-square analysis, respectively. Results: Compared with the CYP2C19*1/*1 group, escitalopram serum concentrations were significantly increased 3.3-fold in the CYP2C19Null/Null group, 1.6-fold in the CYP2C19*Null/*1 group, and 1.4-fold in the CYP2C19Null/*17 group, whereas escitalopram serum concentrations were significantly decreased by 10% in the CYP2C19*1/*17 group and 20% in the CYP1C19*17/*17 group. In comparison to the CYP2C19*1/*1 group, switches from escitalopram to another antidepressant within 1 year were 3.3, 1.6, and 3.0 times more frequent among the CYP2C19Null/Null, CYP2C19*1/*17, and CYP1C19*17/*17 groups, respectively. Conclusions: The CYP2C19 genotype had a substantial impact on exposure and therapeutic failure of escitalopram, as measured by switching of antidepressant therapy. The results support the potential clinical utility of CYP2C19 genotyping for individualization of escitalopram therapy. Effects of aripiprazole on pupillometric parameters related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics after single oral administration to healthy subjects Background: Pupillometry is used for the detection of autonomic dysfunction related to numerous diseases and drug administration. Genetic variants in cytochrome P450 ( CYP2D6, CYP3A4), dopamine receptor ( DRD2, DRD3), serotonin receptor ( HTR2A, HTR2C) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B ( ABCB1) genes were previously associated with aripiprazole response. Aims: Our aim was to evaluate if aripiprazole affects pupil contraction and its relationship with pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics. Methods: Thirty-two healthy volunteers receiving a 10 mg single oral dose of aripiprazole were genotyped for 15 polymorphisms in ABCB1, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A and HTR2C genes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pupil examination was performed by automated pupillometry. Results: Aripiprazole caused pupil constriction and reached the peak value at Cmax. HTR2A rs6313 T allele carriers and HTR2C rs3813929 C/T subjects showed higher maximum constriction velocity and maximum pupil diameter. Besides, Gly/Gly homozygotes for DRD3 rs6280 showed significantly lower maximum constriction velocity values. A/G heterozygotes for DRD2 rs6277 showed higher total time taken by the pupil to recover 75% of the initial resting size values. CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers showed higher area under the curve, Cmax and T1/2 than extensive metabolisers. ABCB1 G2677T/A A/A homozygotes had greater T1/2 in comparison with C/C homozygotes. ABCB1 C3435T T allele carriers and C1236T C/T subjects showed greater area under the curve than C/C homozygotes. Conclusions: Aripiprazole affects pupil contraction, which could be a secondary effect through dopamine and serotonin receptors. Pupillometry could be a useful tool to assess autonomic nervous system activity during antipsychotic treatment. Polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and ABCB1 affect agomelatine pharmacokinetics Background: Agomelatine is an agonist of the melatoninergic receptors used for the treatment of depression. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphisms in metabolising enzymes and the P-glycoprotein transporter on agomelatine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy volunteers receiving a single 25 mg oral dose of agomelatine, were genotyped for nine polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Agomelatine concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry detector. Results: We calculated a CYP1A2 activity score that was directly correlated with agomelatine pharmacokinetics. Individuals with a decreased enzyme activity (*1C carriers) had a lower clearance and accumulated higher concentrations of agomelatine. In contrast, individuals with a high CYP1A2 inducibility (*1F or *1B carriers) showed an extensive clearance and lower agomelatine concentrations. The apparently marked differences between races were due to the different CYP1A2 genotype distribution. CYP2C9 intermediate/poor metabolisers showed a higher area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration. ABCB1 G2677T/A polymorphism affected the time to reach maximum concentration, as subjects carrying A/A+A/T genotypes showed higher values. No association was found for CYP2C19 phenotype. Agomelatine did not produce any change in blood pressure, heart rate or QT interval. Conclusions: CYP1A2 polymorphisms affect agomelatine pharmacokinetics. CYP1A2 phenotype inferred from the genotyping of CYP1A2*1C, *1F and *1B alleles might be a potential predictor of agomelatine exposure. ABCB1 G2677T/A could affect agomelatine absorption, as subjects with A/A+A/T genotypes had lower agomelatine concentration and they take more time to reach the maximum concentration. Plasma neurofilament light chain levels in patients with MS switching from injectable therapies to fingolimod Background: Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of neuroaxonal damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To determine the correlation of NFL in CSF and serum/plasma, and in plasma after switching from injectable MS therapies to fingolimod. Methods: A first cohort consisted of MS patients ( n\\u2009=\\u200939) and neurological disease controls ( n\\u2009=\\u200927) where CSF and plasma/serum had been collected for diagnostic purposes. A second cohort ( n\\u2009=\\u2009243) consisted of patients from a post-marketing study of fingolimod. NFL was determined with Single Molecule Array (Simoa™) technology (detection threshold 1.95\\u2009pg/mL). Results: Mean NFL pg/mL (standard deviation ( SD)) was 341 (267) and 1475 (2358) in CSF and 8.2 (3.58) and 17.0 (16.94) in serum from controls and MS, respectively. CSF/serum and plasma/serum levels were highly correlated ( n\\u2009 =\\u200966, rho\\u2009 =\\u20090.672, p\\u2009 <\\u20090.0001 and n\\u2009 =\\u200916, rho\\u2009 =\\u20090.684, p\\u2009 =\\u20090.009, respectively). In patients starting fingolimod ( n\\u2009=\\u2009243), mean NFL pg/mL ( SD) in plasma was reduced between baseline (20.4 (10.7)) and at 12\\u2009months (13.5 (7.3), p\\u2009<\\u20093\\u2009×\\u200910−6), and levels remained stable at 24\\u2009months (13.2 (6.2)). Conclusion: NFL in serum and CSF are highly correlated and plasma NFL levels decrease after switching to highly effective MS therapy. Blood NFL measurement can be considered as a biomarker for MS therapy response. Hypermethylation of MIR21 in CD4+ T cells from patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis associates with lower miRNA-21 levels and concomitant up-regulation of its target genes Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system caused by genetic and environmental factors. DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that controls genome activity, may provide a link between genetic and environmental risk factors. Objective: We sought to identify DNA methylation changes in CD4+ T cells in patients with relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) and secondary-progressive (SP-MS) disease and healthy controls (HC). Methods: We performed DNA methylation analysis in CD4+ T cells from RR-MS, SP-MS, and HC and associated identified changes with the nearby risk allele, smoking, age, and gene expression. Results: We observed significant methylation differences in the VMP1/MIR21 locus, with RR-MS displaying higher methylation compared to SP-MS and HC. VMP1/MIR21 methylation did not correlate with a known MS risk variant in VMP1 or smoking but displayed a significant negative correlation with age and the levels of mature miR-21 in CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, RR-MS displayed lower levels of miR-21 compared to SP-MS, which might reflect differences in age between the groups, and healthy individuals and a significant enrichment of up-regulated miR-21 target genes. Conclusion: Disease-related changes in epigenetic marking of MIR21 in RR-MS lead to differences in miR-21 expression with a consequence on miR-21 target genes. Left ventricular function in relation to chronic residential air pollution in a general population Background In view of the increasing heart failure epidemic and awareness of the adverse impact of environmental pollution on human health, we investigated the association of left ventricular structure and function with air pollutants in a general population. Methods In 671 randomly recruited Flemish (51.7% women; mean age, 50.4 years) we echocardiographically assessed left ventricular systolic strain and strain rate and the early and late peak velocities of transmitral blood flow and mitral annular movement (2005-2009). Using subject-level data, left ventricular function was cross-sectionally correlated with residential long-term exposure to air pollutants, including black carbon, PM2.5, PM10 (particulate matter) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), while accounting for clustering by residential address and confounders. Results Annual exposures to black carbon, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 averaged 1.19, 13.0, 17.7, and 16.8\\u2009µg/m(3). Systolic left ventricular function was worse ( p\\u2009≤\\u20090.027) with higher black carbon, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 with association sizes per interquartile interval increment ranging from -0.339 to -0.458% for longitudinal strain and from -0.033 to -0.049\\u2009s(-1) for longitudinal strain rate. Mitral E and a\\' peak velocities were lower ( p\\u2009≤\\u20090.021) with higher black carbon, PM2.5 and PM10 with association sizes ranging from -1.727 to -1.947\\u2009cm/s and from -0.175 to -0.235\\u2009cm/s, respectively. In the geographic analysis, the systolic longitudinal strain sided with gradients in air pollution. The path analysis identified systemic inflammation as a possible mediator of associations with black carbon. Conclusions Long-term low-level air pollution is associated with subclinical impairment of left ventricular performance and might be a risk factor for heart failure. ispartof: European Journal of Preventive Cardiology vol:24 issue:13 pages:1416-1428 ispartof: location:England status: published Serum heat shock protein 70 levels as a biomarker for inflammatory processes in multiple sclerosis Background Inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes are hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS). The synthesis of the major stress-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is induced by inflammation. Objective The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hsp70 in serum can serve as a potential biomarker to distinguish inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in MS. Methods Serum was obtained from 94 patients: 26 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 40 relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 19 secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and nine primary progressive MS (PPMS). As controls, serum samples were collected from patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NINDs, n\\u2009=\\u200941), other inflammatory neurological diseases (OINDs, n\\u2009=\\u200928) and healthy donors (HDs, n\\u2009=\\u2009114). Serum levels of Hsp70 were quantified using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting free and liposomal Hsp70 (lipHsp70 ELISA). Results Patients with MS displayed significantly higher Hsp70 serum levels than HDs ( p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and significantly lower levels than OINDs ( p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). A subgroup analysis revealed that Hsp70 serum levels of CIS/RRMS patients are significantly higher than those of patients with progressive MS (SPMS/PPMS) ( p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Conclusion Inflammation causes the release of Hsp70 into the blood. As CIS/RRMS are associated with higher Hsp70 serum levels than progressive MS, serum Hsp70 levels might provide a marker for inflammatory processes. Development and validation of a comprehensive genomic diagnostic tool for myeloid malignancies Key Points We develop and validate Karyogene, a comprehensive one-stop diagnostic platform for the genomic analysis of myeloid malignancies. Karyogene simultaneously detects substitutions, insertions/deletions, translocations, copy number and zygosity changes in a single assay. Zika virus in asymptomatic blood donors in Martinique International audience; Zika fever is an Aedes-borne disease caused by a flavivirus (Zika virus, ZIKV, genus Flavivirus). During the past years ZIKV spread in Polynesia, South-America and the Caribbean. Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or result in mild febrile disease with rash and conjunctivitis. Attention was recently drawn to non-vectored ZIKV transmission, including sexual, probable blood-borne and mother-to-fetus transmission, and to severe forms such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute neurological infections and fetal abnormalities (including microcephaly). Many aspects of Zika fever natural history remain unknown, e.g. the proportion of asymptomatic cases and the duration of viremia. Estimating the prevalence of Zika infections is difficult because a large proportion of infected individuals do not seek medical attention and seroprevalence studies are hampered by antigenic cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, e.g. dengue virus. Here, we present a study of ZIKV infection in blooddonors from Martinique island (French West Indies, Caribbean region), with novel epidemiological, biological and clinical information that refine the picture of Zika fever in adults. Glutaminolysis is a metabolic dependency in FLT3ITD acute myeloid leukemia unmasked by FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition Key Points FLT3ITD TK inhibition impairs glycolysis and glucose utilization without equally affecting glutamine metabolism. Combined targeting of FLT3 TK activity and glutamine metabolism decreases FLT3ITD mutant cells leukemogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Cohesin-dependent regulation of gene expression during differentiation is lost in cohesin-mutated myeloid malignancies Cohesin mutations are common in myeloid malignancy. Sasca et al elucidate the potential role of cohesin loss in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML). They demonstrate that cohesin binding is critical for erythroid-specific gene expression and that reduction in cohesin impairs terminal erythroid maturation and promotes myeloid malignancy. Fast and scalable neural embedding models for biomedical sentence classification Abstract Background Biomedical literature is expanding rapidly, and tools that help locate information of interest are needed. To this end, a multitude of different approaches for classifying sentences in biomedical publications according to their coarse semantic and rhetoric categories (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Conclusions) have been devised, with recent state-of-the-art results reported for a complex deep learning model. Recent evidence showed that shallow and wide neural models such as fastText can provide results that are competitive or superior to complex deep learning models while requiring drastically lower training times and having better scalability. We analyze the efficacy of the fastText model in the classification of biomedical sentences in the PubMed 200k RCT benchmark, and introduce a simple pre-processing step that enables the application of fastText on sentence sequences. Furthermore, we explore the utility of two unsupervised pre-training approaches in scenarios where labeled training data are limited. Results Our fastText-based methodology yields a state-of-the-art F1 score of.917 on the PubMed 200k benchmark when sentence ordering is taken into account, with a training time of only 73 s on standard hardware. Applying fastText on single sentences, without taking sentence ordering into account, yielded an F1 score of.852 (training time 13 s). Unsupervised pre-training of N-gram vectors greatly improved the results for small training set sizes, with an increase of F1 score of.21 to.74 when trained on only 1000 randomly picked sentences without taking sentence ordering into account. Conclusions Because of it’s ease of use and performance, fastText should be among the first choices of tools when tackling biomedical text classification problems with large corpora. Unsupervised pre-training of N-gram vectors on domain-specific corpora also makes it possible to apply fastText when labeled training data are limited. Neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain Background Neural\\xa0network based embedding models are receiving significant attention in the field of natural language processing due to their capability to effectively capture semantic information representing words, sentences or even larger text elements in low-dimensional vector space. While current state-of-the-art models for assessing the semantic similarity of textual statements from biomedical publications depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, unsupervised neural embedding models only require large text corpora as input and do not need manual curation. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of current state-of-the-art neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation of sentences from biomedical literature. We trained different neural embedding models on 1.7 million\\xa0articles from the PubMed Open Access dataset, and evaluated them based on a biomedical benchmark set containing 100 sentence pairs annotated by human experts and a smaller contradiction subset derived from the original benchmark set. Results Experimental results showed that, with a Pearson correlation of 0.819, our best unsupervised model based on the Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art results achieved on the BIOSSES biomedical benchmark set. Moreover, our proposed supervised model that combines different string-based similarity metrics with a neural embedding model surpasses previous ontology-dependent supervised state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Pearson’s r (r\\u2009=\\u20090.871) on the biomedical benchmark set. In contrast to the promising results for the original benchmark, we found our best models’ performance on the smaller contradiction subset to be poor. Conclusions In this study, we have highlighted the value of neural network-based models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain by showing that they can keep up with and even surpass previous state-of-the-art approaches for semantic similarity estimation that depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, when evaluated on a biomedical benchmark set. Capturing contradictions and negations in biomedical sentences, however, emerged as an essential area for further work.

DNAscan: personal computer compatible NGS analysis, annotation and visualisation Background Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a commonly used technology for studying the genetic basis of biological processes and it underpins the aspirations of precision medicine. However, there are significant challenges when dealing with NGS data. Firstly, a huge number of bioinformatics tools for a wide range of uses exist, therefore it is challenging to design an analysis pipeline. Secondly, NGS analysis is computationally intensive, requiring expensive infrastructure, and many medical and research centres do not have adequate high performance computing facilities and cloud computing is not always an option due to privacy and ownership issues. Finally, the interpretation of the results is not trivial and most available pipelines lack the utilities to favour this crucial step. Results We have therefore developed a fast and efficient bioinformatics pipeline that allows for the analysis of DNA sequencing data, while requiring little computational effort and memory usage. DNAscan can analyse a whole exome sequencing sample in 1\\u2009h and a 40x whole genome sequencing sample in 13\\u2009h, on a midrange computer. The pipeline can look for single nucleotide variants, small indels, structural variants, repeat expansions and viral genetic material (or any other organism). Its results are annotated using a customisable variety of databases and are available for an on-the-fly visualisation with a local deployment of the gene.iobio platform. DNAscan is implemented in Python. Its code and documentation are available on GitHub: https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/DNAscan. Instructions for an easy and fast deployment with Docker and Singularity are also provided on GitHub. Conclusions DNAscan is an extremely fast and computationally efficient pipeline for analysis, visualization and interpretation of NGS data. It is designed to provide a powerful and easy-to-use tool for applications in biomedical research and diagnostic medicine, at minimal computational cost. Its comprehensive approach will maximise the potential audience of users, bringing such analyses within the reach of non-specialist laboratories, and those from centres with limited funding available.

Exploring the druggable space around the Fanconi anemia pathway using machine learning and mechanistic models Background: In spite of the abundance of genomic data, predictive models that describe phenotypes as a function of gene expression or mutations are difficult to obtain because they are affected by the curse of dimensionality, given the disbalance between samples and candidate genes. And this is especially dramatic in scenarios in which the availability of samples is difficult, such as the case of rare diseases. Results: The application of multi-output regression machine learning methodologies to predict the potential effect of external proteins over the signaling circuits that trigger Fanconi anemia related cell functionalities, inferred with a mechanistic model, allowed us to detect over 20 potential therapeutic targets. Conclusions: The use of artificial intelligence methods for the prediction of potentially causal relationships between proteins of interest and cell activities related with disease-related phenotypes opens promising avenues for the systematic search of new targets in rare diseases. Evaluation of Galleria mellonella larvae for studying the virulence of Streptococcus suis Background Streptococcus suis is an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium and the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in young pigs, resulting in considerable economic losses in the porcine industry. S. suis is considered an emerging zoonotic agent with increasing numbers of human cases over the last years. In the environment, both avirulent and virulent strains occur in pigs,\\xa0with no evidence for consistent adapatation of virulent strains to the human host. Currently, there is an urgent need for a convenient, reliable and\\xa0standardised animal model to rapidly\\xa0assess S. suis virulence. Wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae have successfully been used in human and animal infectious disease studies. Here, we developed G. mellonella larvae as a model to assess virulence of S. suis strains. Results Fourteen isolates of S. suis belonging to different serotypes killed G. mellonella larvae in a dose-dependent manner. Larvae infected with the virulent serotype 2 strain, S. suis S3881/S10, were rescued by antibiotic therapy. Crucially, the\\xa0observed virulence of the different serotypes and mutants was in agreement with virulence observed in piglets (Sus scrofa) and the\\xa0zebrafish larval infection model. Infection with heat-inactivated bacteria or bacteria-free culture supernatants showed that in most cases live bacteria are needed\\xa0to cause mortality in G. mellonella. Conclusions The G. mellonella model is simple, cost-efficient, and raises less ethical issues than experiments on vertebrates and reduces infrastructure requirements. Furthermore, it allows experiments to be performed at the host temperature (37\\xa0°C). The results reported here, indicate that the G. mellonella model may aid our understanding of veterinary microbial pathogens such as the emerging zoonotic pathogen S. suis and generate hypotheses for testing in the target animal host. Ultimately, this might lead to the timely introduction of new effective remedies for infectious diseases. Last but not least, use of the G. mellonella infection model to study S. suis virulence adheres to the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement (3Rs) and can potentially reduce the number of vertebrates used for experimental infection studies.

Soluble CD14 in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with markers of inflammation and axonal damage in untreated HIV-infected patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study Background: HIV-associated cognitive impairment has declined since the introduction of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART). However, milder forms of cognitive impairment persist. Inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been associated with cognitive impairment, and CSF neurofilament light chain protein (NFL) and CSF neopterin concentrations are increased in those patients. Microbial translocation in HIV infection has been suggested to contribute to chronic inflammation, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) are markers of microbial translocation and the resulting monocyte activation, respectively. We hypothesised that microbial translocation contributes to inflammation and axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS) in untreated HIV infection. / Methods: We analyzed paired samples of plasma and CSF from 62 HIV-infected, untreated patients without cognitive symptoms from Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Measurements of neopterin and NFL in CSF were available from previous studies. Plasma and CSF sCD14 was measured using ELISA (R&D, Minneapolis, MN), and plasma and CSF LPS was measured using LAL colorimetric assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. / Results: LPS in plasma was associated with plasma sCD14 (r\\u2009=\\u20090.31, P\\u2009=\\u20090.015), and plasma sCD14 was associated with CSF sCD14 (r\\u2009=\\u20090.32, P\\u2009=\\u20090.012). Furthermore, CSF sCD14 was associated with NFL (r\\u2009=\\u20090.32, P\\u2009=\\u20090.031) and neopterin (r\\u2009=\\u20090.32, P\\u2009=\\u20090.012) in CSF. LPS was not detectable in CSF. In a multivariate regression model CSF sCD14 remained associated with NFL and neopterin after adjusting for age, CD4+ cell count, and HIV RNA in CSF. / Conclusions: In a group of untreated, HIV-infected patients LPS was associated with sCD14 in plasma, and plasma sCD14 was associated CSF sCD14. CSF sCD14 were associated with markers of CNS inflammation and axonal damage. This suggest that microbial translocation might be a driver of systemic and CNS inflammation. However, LPS was not detectable in the CSF, and since sCD14 is a marker of monocyte activation sCD14 may be increased due to other causes than microbial translocation. Further studies regarding cognitive impairment and biomarkers are warranted to fully understand causality. PEAR1 is not a major susceptibility gene for cardiovascular disease in a Flemish population Background Platelet Endothelial Aggregation Receptor 1 (PEAR1), a membrane protein highly expressed in platelets and endothelial cells, plays a role in platelet contact-induced activation, sustained platelet aggregation and endothelial function. Previous reports implicate PEAR1 rs12041331 as a variant influencing risk in patients with coronary heart disease. We investigated whether genetic variation in PEAR1 predicts cardiovascular outcome in a white population. Methods In 1938 participants enrolled in the Flemish Study on Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (51.3% women; mean age 43.6\\xa0years), we genotyped 9 tagging SNPs in PEAR1, measured baseline cardiovascular risk factors, and recorded Cardiovascular disease incidence. For SNPs, we contrasted cardiovascular disease incidence of minor-allele heterozygotes and homozygotes (variant) vs. major-allele homozygotes (reference) and for haplotypes carriers vs. non-carriers. In adjusted analyses, we accounted for family clusters and baseline covariables, including sex, age, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, smoking and drinking, antihypertensive drug treatment, and history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Results Over a median follow-up of 15.3\\xa0years, 238 died and 181 experienced a major cardiovascular endpoint. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of eight PEAR1 SNPs, including rs12566888, ranged from 0.87 to 1.07 (P\\u2009≥0.35) and from 0.78 to 1.30 (P\\u2009≥0.15), respectively. The hazard ratios of three haplotypes with frequency ≥10% ranged from 0.93 to 1.11 (P\\u2009≥0.49) for mortality and from 0.84 to 1.03 (P\\u2009≥0.29) for a cardiovascular complications. These results were not influenced by intake of antiplatelet drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or both (P-values for interaction\\u2009≥\\u20090.056). Conclusions In a White population, we could not replicate previous reports from experimental studies or obtained in patients suggesting that PEAR1 might be a susceptibility gene for cardiovascular complications.

Somatic drivers of B-ALL in a model of ETV6-RUNX1; Pax5 +/− leukemia Abstract Background B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is amongst the leading causes of childhood cancer-related mortality. Its most common chromosomal aberration is the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, with ~25\\xa0% of ETV6-RUNX1 patients also carrying PAX5 alterations. Methods We have recreated this mutation background by inter-crossing Etv6-RUNX1 (Etv6 RUNX1-SB ) and Pax5 +/− mice and performed an in vivo analysis to find driver genes using Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated mutagenesis and also exome sequencing. Results Combination of Etv6-RUNX1 and Pax5 +/− alleles generated a transplantable B220\\u2009+\\u2009CD19+ B-ALL with a significant disease incidence. RNA-seq analysis showed a gene expression pattern consistent with arrest at the pre-B stage. Analysis of the transposon common insertion sites identified genes involved in B-cell development (Zfp423) and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Jak1, Stat5 and Il2rb), while exome sequencing revealed somatic hotspot mutations in Jak1 and Jak3 at residues analogous to those mutated in human leukemias, and also mutation of Trp53. Conclusions Powerful synergies exists in our model suggesting STAT pathway activation and mutation of Trp53 are potent drivers of B-ALL in the context of Etv6-RUNX1;Pax5 +/− . A tissue-specific protein purification approach in Caenorhabditis elegans identifies novel interaction partners of DLG-1/Discs large Background: Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) is a widely used approach to identify protein interactions and complexes. In multicellular organisms, the accurate identification of protein complexes by AP/MS is complicated by the potential heterogeneity of complexes in different tissues. Here, we present an in vivo biotinylation-based approach for the tissue-specific purification of protein complexes from Caenorhabditis elegans. Tissue-specific biotinylation is achieved by the expression in select tissues of the bacterial biotin ligase BirA, which biotinylates proteins tagged with the Avi peptide. Results: We generated N- and C-terminal tags combining GFP with the Avi peptide sequence, as well as four BirA driver lines expressing BirA ubiquitously and specifically in the seam and hyp7 epidermal cells, intestine, or neurons. We validated the ability of our approach to identify bona fide protein interactions by identifying the known LGL-1 interaction partners PAR-6 and PKC-3. Purification of the Discs large protein DLG-1 identified several candidate interaction partners, including the AAA-type ATPase ATAD-3 and the uncharacterized protein MAPH-1.1. We have identified the domains that mediate the DLG-1/ATAD-3 interaction, and show that this interaction contributes to C. elegans development. MAPH-1.1 co-purified specifically with DLG-1 purified from neurons, and shared limited homology with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1A, a known neuronal interaction partner of mammalian DLG4/PSD95. A CRISPR/Cas9-engineered GFP::MAPH-1.1 fusion was broadly expressed and co-localized with microtubules. Conclusions: The method we present here is able to purify protein complexes from specific tissues. We uncovered a series of DLG-1 interactors, and conclude that ATAD-3 is a biologically relevant interaction partner of DLG-1. Finally, we conclude that MAPH-1.1 is a microtubule-associated protein of the MAP1 family and a candidate neuron-specific interaction partner of DLG-1.

Lifestyle precision medicine: the next generation in type 2 diabetes prevention? The driving force behind the current global type 2 diabetes epidemic is insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals. Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain ‘prediabetic’ or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale. The emergence of biomarker technologies has allowed more targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes prevention (precision medicine), though largely confined to pharmacotherapy. Unlike most drugs, lifestyle interventions often have systemic health-enhancing effects. Thus, the pursuance of lifestyle precision medicine in diabetes seems rational. Herein, we review the literature on lifestyle interventions and diabetes prevention, describing the biological systems that can be characterized at scale in human populations, linking them to lifestyle in diabetes, and consider some of the challenges impeding the clinical translation of lifestyle precision medicine.

A versatile one-step CRISPR-Cas9 based approach to plasmid-curing Background Plasmids are widely used and essential tools in molecular biology. However, plasmids often impose a metabolic burden and are only temporarily useful for genetic engineering, bio-sensing and characterization purposes. While numerous techniques for genetic manipulation exist, a universal tool enabling rapid removal of plasmids from bacterial cells is lacking. Results Based on replicon abundance and sequence conservation analysis, we show that the vast majority of bacterial cloning and expression vectors share sequence similarities that allow for broad CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. We have constructed a universal plasmid-curing system (pFREE) and developed a one-step protocol and PCR procedure that allow for identification of plasmid-free clones within 24\\xa0h. While the context of the targeted replicons affects efficiency, we obtained curing efficiencies between 40 and 100% for the plasmids most widely used for expression and engineering purposes. By virtue of the CRISPR-Cas9 targeting, our platform is highly expandable and can be applied in a broad host context. We exemplify the wide applicability of our system in Gram-negative bacteria by demonstrating the successful application in both Escherichia coli and the promising cell factory chassis Pseudomonas putida. Conclusion As a fast and freely available plasmid-curing system, targeting virtually all vectors used for cloning and expression purposes, we believe that pFREE has the potential to eliminate the need for individualized vector suicide solutions in molecular biology. We envision the application of pFREE to be especially useful in methodologies involving multiple plasmids, used sequentially or simultaneously, which are becoming increasingly popular for genome editing or combinatorial pathway engineering.

Letter to editor: Blood pressure, hypertension and lead exposure A significant association of office diastolic blood pressure with low-level blood lead exposure was reported in a Brazilian adult population. However, caution should be taken to interpret these results. The multivariable-adjusted association with blood pressure was positive for diastolic blood pressure, but inverse for systolic blood pressure. The association sizes were infinitesimal without clinical relevance. The outcome measures, i.e. blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension were analysed across categories of the blood lead distribution - not in relation to blood lead as continuous variable. Blood pressure was the average of two oscillometric office readings, whereas ambulatory monitoring is the state-of-the-art. ispartof: Environmental Health vol:17 issue:1 pages:16- ispartof: location:England status: published Plasma neurofilament light chain and amyloid-β are associated with the kynurenine pathway metabolites in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease Abstract Background Blood markers indicative of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain; NFL), Alzheimer’s disease amyloid pathology (amyloid-β; Aβ), and neuroinflammation (kynurenine pathway; KP metabolites) have been investigated independently in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the association of these markers of neurodegeneration and AD pathology with neuroinflammation has not been investigated previously. Therefore, the current study examined whether NFL and Aβ correlate with KP metabolites in elderly individuals to provide insight on the association between blood indicators of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Methods Correlations between KP metabolites, measured using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and plasma NFL and Aβ concentrations, measured using single molecule array (Simoa) assays, were investigated in elderly individuals aged 65–90\\u2009years, with normal global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination Score\\u2009≥\\u200926) from the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health cohort. Results A positive correlation between NFL and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (K/T) reflecting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was observed (r\\u2009=\\u2009.451, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0001). Positive correlations were also observed between NFL and kynurenine (r\\u2009=\\u2009.364, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005), kynurenic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.384, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0001), 3-hydroxykynurenine (r\\u2009=\\u2009.246, p\\u2009=\\u2009.014), anthranilic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.311, p\\u2009=\\u2009.002), and quinolinic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.296, p\\u2009=\\u2009.003). Further, significant associations were observed between plasma Aβ40 and the K/T (r\\u2009=\\u2009.375, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005), kynurenine (r\\u2009=\\u2009.374, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005), kynurenic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.352, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005), anthranilic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.381, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005), and quinolinic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.352, p\\u2009<\\u2009.0005). Significant associations were also observed between plasma Aβ42 and the K/T ratio (r\\u2009=\\u2009.215, p\\u2009=\\u2009.034), kynurenic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.214, p\\u2009=\\u2009.035), anthranilic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.278, p\\u2009=\\u2009.006), and quinolinic acid (r\\u2009=\\u2009.224, p\\u2009=\\u2009.027) in the cohort. On stratifying participants based on their neocortical Aβ load (NAL) status, NFL correlated with KP metabolites irrespective of NAL status; however, associations between plasma Aβ and KP metabolites were only pronounced in individuals with high NAL while associations in individuals with low NAL were nearly absent. Conclusions The current study shows that KP metabolite changes are associated with biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration. Additionally, the association between KP metabolites and plasma Aβ seems to be NAL status dependent. Finally, the current study suggests that an association between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation manifests in the periphery, suggesting that preventing cytoskeleton cytotoxicity by KP metabolites may have therapeutic potential. Cytokine and immune cell profiling in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neuro-inflammatory diseases Abstract Background Cytokines play multiple roles during neuro-inflammatory processes and several cytokines have been studied in the context of specific diseases. This study provides a comprehensive picture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes during neuro-inflammation by analyzing multiple cytokines in combination with immune cell subsets and standard CSF parameters. Methods Using multiplex assays, we simultaneously measured 36 cytokines (CCL1–3, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL19, CCL20, CCL22–27, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL11–13, CXCL16, CX3CL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL16, GM-CSF, IFNγ, MIF, TNFα, and MIB1β) in the CSF and serum of 75 subjects. Diagnoses included clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS, n\\xa0=\\u200918), secondary progressive MS (n\\xa0=\\u20098), neuro-syphilis (n\\xa0=\\u20096), Lyme neuro-borreliosis (n\\xa0=\\u200913), bacterial and viral meningitis (n\\xa0=\\u200920), and patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND, n\\xa0=\\u200910). Cytokine concentrations were correlated with CSF standard parameters and CSF immune cell subsets (CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, plasmablasts, monocytes, and NK cells) quantified by flow cytometry. Results We observed increased levels of multiple cytokines (26/36) in patients with neuro-inflammatory diseases when compared to NIND that consistently correlated with CSF cell count and QAlbumin. Most CSF cytokine concentrations correlated with each other, but correlations between CSF and serum values were scarce (3/36). Within the CSF compartment, CXCL13 showed a strong association with B cells when analyzing all patients, as well as patients with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). NK cells positively correlated with CSF concentrations of multiple cytokines (22/36) when analyzing all patients. These correlations were maintained when looking at patients with a disrupted BBB but not detectable in patients with an intact BBB. Conclusions Under conditions of neuro-inflammation, multiple CSF cytokines are regulated in parallel and most likely produced locally. A combined increase of CSF CXCL13 levels and B cells occurs under conditions of an intact BBB. Under conditions of a disrupted BBB, CSF NK cells show significantly increased values and seem to have a major contribution to overall inflammatory processes, reflected by a strong correlation with multiple cytokines. Future studies are necessary to address the exact kinetics of these cytokines during neuro-inflammation and their relation to specific diseases phenotypes. Amyloid mis-metabolism in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) have reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid-β (Aβ) and α- and β-cleaved soluble forms of amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα and sAPPβ). The aims of this study were to examine if changes could also be seen in the CSF for secreted metabolites of APP-like protein 1 (APLP1) and to explore the prognostic value of amyloid-related CSF biomarkers, as well as markers of neuronal injury and astroglial activation, as regards to clinical outcome after shunt surgery. METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with iNPH, 10 improved and 10 unchanged by shunt surgery, and 20 neurologically healthy controls were included. All patients were examined clinically prior to surgery and at 6-month follow-up after surgery using the iNPH scale. Lumbar puncture was performed pre-operatively. CSF samples were analyzed for neurofilament light (NFL), Aβ isoforms Aβ38, Aβ40 and Aβ42, sAPPα, sAPPβ, APLP1 β-derived peptides APL1β25, APL1β 27 and APL1β 28 and YKL40 by immunochemical methods. RESULTS: The concentrations of all soluble forms of APP, all Aβ isoforms and APL1β28 were lower, whilst APL1β25 and APL1β27 were higher in the CSF of iNPH patients compared to controls. There was no difference in biomarker concentrations between patients who improved after surgery and those who remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced CSF concentrations of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, sAPPα and sAPPβ suggest that APP expression could be downregulated in iNPH. In contrast, APLP1 concentration in the CSF seems relatively unchanged. The increase of APL1β25 and APL1β27 in combination with a slight decreased APL1β28 could be caused by more available γ-secretase due to reduced availability of its primary substrate, APP. The data did not support the use of these markers as indicators of shunt responsiveness. Joint genome-wide association study of progressive supranuclear palsy identifies novel susceptibility loci and genetic correlation to neurodegenerative diseases Background Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease for which the genetic contribution is incompletely understood. Methods We conducted a joint analysis of 5,523,934 imputed SNPs in two newly-genotyped progressive supranuclear palsy cohorts, primarily derived from two clinical trials (Allon davunetide and NNIPPS riluzole trials in PSP) and a previously published genome-wide association study (GWAS), in total comprising 1646 cases and 10,662 controls of European ancestry. Results We identified 5 associated loci at a genome-wide significance threshold P\\u2009<\\u20095\\u2009×\\u200910−\\u20098, including replication of 3 loci from previous studies and 2 novel loci at 6p21.1 and 12p12.1 (near RUNX2 and SLCO1A2, respectively). At the 17q21.31 locus, stepwise regression analysis confirmed the presence of multiple independent loci (localized near MAPT and KANSL1). An additional 4 loci were highly suggestive of association (P\\u2009<\\u20091\\u2009×\\u200910−\\u20096). We analyzed the genetic correlation with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and found that PSP had shared polygenic heritability with Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Conclusions In total, we identified 6 additional significant or suggestive SNP associations with PSP, and discovered genetic overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings clarify the pathogenesis and genetic architecture of PSP.

Antifibrotic and molecular aspects of rifaximin in alcoholic liver disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Background Alcoholic liver disease is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide. Due to an increase in alcohol overuse, alcoholic liver disease has become an increased burden on health care systems. Abstinence from alcohol remains the cornerstone of alcoholic liver disease treatment; however, this approach is hampered by frequent relapse and lack of specific therapy for treating advanced cases of liver disease. In the present study, we hypothesized that gut microbiota drive the development of liver fibrosis and that modulation of gut microbiota with the gut-selective, nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin attenuates alcoholic liver fibrosis. Methods/design Our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will include 136 participants with biopsy-verified alcoholic fibrosis (Ishak liver fibrosis score of 1–4). Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or 550 mg of rifaximin twice daily for 18 months. A liver biopsy will be performed at the end of the treatment period to evaluate the effect of drug treatment on liver fibrosis. Stool, urine, and saliva specimens will be collected before treatment begins, at 1 month, and at the end of the treatment period. Fecal samples are used for microbiome deep sequencing. Changes in microbiome composition are compared before and after the trial medication period and linked to changes in liver fibrosis. Discussion This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the effect of gut microbiota on liver fibrosis in humans. If gut microbiota are an important promoter of alcoholic liver disease, current results may open new therapeutic avenues and revolutionize the current understanding of chronic liver diseases.

Onchocerciasis transmission in Ghana: the human blood index of sibling species of the Simulium damnosum complex Background Vector-biting behaviour is important for vector-borne disease (VBD) epidemiology. The proportion of blood meals taken on humans (the human blood index, HBI), is a component of the biting rate per vector on humans in VBD transmission models. Humans are the definitive host of Onchocerca volvulus, but the simuliid vectors feed on a range of animals and HBI is a key indicator of the potential for human onchocerciasis transmission. Ghana has a diversity of Simulium damnosum complex members, which are likely to vary in their HBIs, an important consideration for parameterization of onchocerciasis control and elimination models. Methods Host-seeking and ovipositing\\xa0S. damnosum\\xa0(sensu lato) (s.l.) were collected from seven villages in four Ghanaian regions. Taxa were morphologically and molecularly identified. Blood meals from individually stored blackfly abdomens were used for DNA profiling, to identify previous host choice. Household, domestic animal, wild mammal and bird surveys were performed to estimate the density and diversity of potential blood hosts of blackflies. Results A total of 11,107 abdomens of simuliid females (which would have obtained blood meal(s) previously) were tested, with blood meals successfully amplified in 3,772 (34\\xa0%). A single-host species was identified in 2,857 (75.7\\xa0%) of the blood meals, of which 2,162 (75.7\\xa0%) were human. Simulium soubrense Beffa form, S. squamosum C and S. sanctipauli Pra form were the most anthropophagic (HBI\\u2009=\\u20090.92, 0.86 and 0.70, respectively); S. squamosum E, S. yahense and\\xa0S. damnosum\\xa0(sensu stricto) (s.s.)/S. sirbanum were the most zoophagic (HBI\\u2009=\\u20090.44, 0.53 and 0.63, respectively). The degree of anthropophagy decreased (but not statistically significantly) with increasing ratio of non-human/human blood hosts. Vector to human ratios ranged from 139 to 1,198 blackflies/person. Conclusions DNA profiling can successfully identify blood meals from host-seeking and ovipositing blackflies. Host choice varies according to sibling species, season and capture site/method. There was no evidence that HBI is vector and/or host density dependent. Transmission breakpoints will vary among locations due to differing cytospecies compositions and vector abundances.

Phenotypic and genotypic monitoring of Schistosoma mansoni in Tanzanian schoolchildren five years into a preventative chemotherapy national control programme Background Schistosoma mansoni is a parasite of profound medical importance. Current control focusses on mass praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of populations in endemic areas, termed Preventative Chemotherapy (PC). Large-scale PC programmes exert prolonged selection pressures on parasites with the potential for, direct and/or indirect, emergence of drug resistance. Molecular methods can help monitor genetic changes of schistosome populations over time and in response to drug treatment, as well as estimate adult worm burdens through parentage analysis. Furthermore, methods such as in vitro drug sensitivity assays help phenotype in vivo parasite genotypic drug efficacy. Methods We conducted combined in vitro PZQ efficacy testing with population genetic analyses of S. mansoni collected from children from two schools in 2010, five years after the introduction of a National Control Programme. Children at one school had received four annual PZQ treatments and the other school had received two mass treatments in total. We compared genetic differentiation, indices of genetic diversity, and estimated adult worm burden from parasites collected in 2010 with samples collected in 2005 (before the control programme began) and in 2006 (six months after the first PZQ treatment). Using 2010 larval samples, we also compared the genetic similarity of those with high and low in vitro sensitivity to PZQ. Results We demonstrated that there were individual parasites with reduced PZQ susceptibility in the 2010 collections, as evidenced by our in vitro larval behavioural phenotypic assay. There was no evidence, however, that miracidia showing phenotypically reduced susceptibility clustered together genetically. Molecular analysis also demonstrated a significant reduction of adult worm load over time, despite little evidence of reduction in parasite infection intensity, as measured by egg output. Genetic diversity of infections did not reduce over time, despite changes in the genetic composition of the parasite populations. Conclusions Genotypic and phenotypic monitoring did not indicate a selective sweep, as may be expected if PZQ treatment was selecting a small number of related “resistant” parasites, but there was evidence of genetic changes at the population level over time. Genetic data were used to estimate adult worm burdens, which unlike parasite infection intensity, showed reductions over time, suggesting the relaxation of negative density-dependent constraints on parasite fecundity with PZQ treatment. We thereby demonstrated that density-dependence in schistosome populations may complicate evaluation and monitoring of control programmes.

Understanding the relationship between egg- and antigen-based diagnostics of Schistosoma mansoni infection pre- and post-treatment in Uganda Background Schistosomiasis is a major socio-economic and public health problem in many sub-Saharan African countries. After large mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, prevalence of infection rapidly returns to pre-treatment levels. The traditional egg-based diagnostic for schistosome infections, Kato-Katz, is being substituted in many settings by circulating antigen recognition-based diagnostics, usually the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (CCA). The relationship between these diagnostics is poorly understood, particularly after treatment in both drug-efficacy studies and routine monitoring. Results We created a model of schistosome infections to better understand and quantify the relationship between these two egg- and adult worm antigen-based diagnostics. We focused particularly on the interpretation of “trace” results after CCA testing. Our analyses suggest that CCA is generally a better predictor of prevalence, particularly after treatment, and that trace CCA results are typically associated with truly infected individuals. Conclusions Even though prevalence rises to pre-treatment levels only six months after MDAs, our model suggests that the average intensity of infection is much lower, and is probably in part due to a small burden of surviving juveniles from when the treatment occurred. This work helps to better understand CCA diagnostics and the interpretation of post-treatment prevalence estimations.

Genetic variation in human drug-related genes Background: Variability in drug efficacy and adverse effects are observed in clinical practice. While the extent of genetic variability in classic pharmacokinetic genes is rather well understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is typically less studied. Methods: Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of functional variants in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We further computed the likelihood of 1236 FDA-approved drugs to be affected by functional variants in their targets in the whole ExAC population as well as different geographic sub-populations. Results: We find that most genetic variants in drug-related genes are very rare (f < 0.1%) and thus will likely not be observed in clinical trials. Furthermore, we show that patient risk varies for many drugs and with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying germline variants in oncological drug targets is, at 44%, high enough to suggest that not only somatic alterations but also germline variants carried over into the tumor genome could affect the response to antineoplastic agents. Conclusions: This study indicates that even though many variants are very rare and thus likely not observed in clinical trials, four in five patients are likely to carry a variant with possibly functional effects in a target for commonly prescribed drugs. Such variants could potentially alter drug efficacy.

Increased DNA methylation variability in rheumatoid arthritis-discordant monozygotic twins ABSTRACTBackgroundRheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenome-wide association studies can identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation, which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in disease discordant monozygotic twin pairs.MethodsGenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 79 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for rheumatoid arthritis using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina). Discordant twins were tested for both differential DNA methylation and methylation variability between RA and healthy twins. The methylation variability signature was then compared with methylation variants from studies of other autoimmune diseases and with an independent healthy population.ResultsWe have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature, that suggests multiple stress response pathways may be involved in the aetiology of the disease. This methylation variability signature also highlighted potential epigenetic disruption of multiple RUNX3 transcription factor binding sites as being associated with disease development. Comparison with previously performed epigenome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes identified shared pathways for autoimmune disorders, suggesting that epigenetics plays a role in autoimmunity and offering the possibility of identifying new targets for intervention.ConclusionsThrough genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in disease discordant monozygotic twins, we have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature, in the absence of differential methylation in rheumatoid arthritis. This finding supports the importance of epigenetic variability as an emerging component in autoimmune disorders. Towards a European health research and innovation cloud (HRIC) The European Union (EU) initiative on the Digital Transformation of Health and Care (Digicare) aims to provide the conditions necessary for building a secure, flexible, and decentralized digital health infrastructure. Creating a European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC) within this environment should enable data sharing and analysis for health research across the EU, in compliance with data protection legislation while preserving the full trust of the participants. Such a HRIC should learn from and build on existing data infrastructures, integrate best practices, and focus on the concrete needs of the community in terms of technologies, governance, management, regulation, and ethics requirements. Here, we describe the vision and expected benefits of digital data sharing in health research activities and present a roadmap that fosters the opportunities while answering the challenges of implementing a HRIC. For this, we put forward five specific recommendations and action points to ensure that a European HRIC: i) is built on established standards and guidelines, providing cloud technologies through an open and decentralized infrastructure; ii) is developed and certified to the highest standards of interoperability and data security that can be trusted by all stakeholders; iii) is supported by a robust ethical and legal framework that is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); iv) establishes a proper environment for the training of new generations of data and medical scientists; and v) stimulates research and innovation in transnational collaborations through public and private initiatives and partnerships funded by the EU through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. Inflammation functions as a key mediator in the link between ACPA and erosion development: an association study in Clinically Suspect Arthralgia Background Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are associated with more severe joint erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Recent in vitro and murine studies indicate that ACPAs can directly activate osteoclasts leading to bone erosions and pain. This study sought evidence for this hypothesis in humans and evaluated whether in patients with arthralgia who are at risk of RA, ACPA is associated with erosions (detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) independent of inflammation, and also independent of the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF). Methods Patients with Clinically Suspect Arthralgia (n = 507) underwent determination of ACPA and RF and 1.5\\xa0T contrast-enhanced MRI of the metacarpophalangeal, wrist and metatarsophalangeal joints at baseline. MRIs were scored for presence of local inflammation and erosions. Comparisons of erosion scores were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. To evaluate if inflammation is, in statistical terms, intermediary in the causal path of ACPA and erosions, three-step mediation analysis was performed using linear regression. Results ACPA-positive patients had higher erosion scores than ACPA-negative patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). ACPA-positive patients without subclinical inflammation did not have higher erosion scores than ACPA-negative patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.68), in contrast to ACPA-positive patients with local inflammation (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mediation analyses suggested that local inflammation is in the causal path of ACPA leading to higher erosion scores. Compared to ACPA-negative/RF-negative patients, ACPA-positive/RF-negative patients did not differ (p\\u2009=\\u20090.30), but ACPA-positive/RF-positive patients had higher erosion scores (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). Conclusions The effect of ACPA on erosions is mediated by inflammation and is not independent of RF.

Does information on novel identified autoantibodies contribute to predicting the progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: a study on anti-CarP antibodies as an example Abstract Background The presence of autoantibodies is considered an important characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, both anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) are included in the 2010 classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a considerable number of RA patients lack both these autoantibodies. Recently, several novel autoantibodies have been identified but their value for the classification of RA patients is unclear. Therefore, we studied the value of novel autoantibodies using the presence of anticarbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies as an example for predicting RA development in patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA). Methods There were 1352 UA patients included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC) cohort according to the 1987 criteria. When the 2010 criteria were used, there were 838 UA patients. Of these, we evaluated whether they fulfilled the 1987 or 2010 criteria after 1\\xa0year, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed with RA as outcome and ACPA, RF, and anti-CarP antibodies as predictors. Analyses were repeated after stratification for ACPA and RF. Results Thirty-three percent of the 1987-UA patients and 6% of the 2010-UA patients progressed to RA during the first year of follow-up. For the 1987-UA patients, anti-CarP antibodies were associated with progression to RA, an association which remained when a correction was made for the presence of ACPA and RF (odds ratio (OR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–2.4). After stratification for ACPA and RF, anti-CarP antibodies were associated with progression to RA only for ACPA- and RF-negative patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.7). For the 2010-UA patients, anti-CarP antibodies were associated with progression to RA; however, they were not when a correction was made for the presence of ACPA and RF (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3–2.1). Conclusions Our finding that anti-CarP antibodies have no additional value when RA is defined according to the 2010 criteria might be inherent to the composition of the 2010 criteria and therefore might also apply to other novel autoantibodies. Potentially it would be interesting to evaluate other, non-autoantibody biomarkers. Sequence of joint tissue inflammation during rheumatoid arthritis development Objective Subclinical joint inflammation in patients with arthralgia is predictive for progression to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the time course of progression for bone marrow edema (osteitis), synovitis, and/or tenosynovitis is unsettled. This longitudinal study assessed the course of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical joint inflammation during progression to RA. Methods Patients that progressed from clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) to RA underwent 1.5-T MRI of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrist, and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints at presentation with arthralgia and at first identification of synovitis assessed through physical examination (n\\u2009=\\u200931). MRIs were evaluated for osteitis, synovitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions by two readers, blinded for clinical data and order in time. To estimate changes in MRI scores between the asymptomatic state and CSA onset, scores of MRI features at CSA baseline were compared with scores from age-matched symptom-free persons. Results At presentation with CSA, synovitis and tenosynovitis scores were higher than scores from age-matched symptom-free persons (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004 and p\\u2009=\\u20090.001, respectively). Anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive arthralgia patients also had increased osteitis scores (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). Median duration between presentation with arthralgia and RA development was 17\\xa0weeks. During progression to RA, synovitis and osteitis increased significantly (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001 and p\\u2009=\\u20090.036, respectively) in contrast to tenosynovitis and erosion scores. This pattern was similar in both ACPA subsets, although statistical significance was reached for synovitis and osteitis in ACPA-negative but not ACPA-positive RA. Conclusion Increased tenosynovitis and synovitis scores at CSA onset and the increase in synovitis and osteitis during progression to RA suggest an ‘outside-in’ temporal relationship of arthritis development, in particular for ACPA-negative RA. For ACPA-positive RA, further studies are needed.

Do musculoskeletal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging identify synovitis and tenosynovitis at the same joints and tendons? A comparative study in early inflammatory arthritis and clinically suspect arthralgia Objective Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommended in the diagnostic process of rheumatoid arthritis. Research on its comparability in early disease phases is scarce. Therefore, we compared synovitis and tenosynovitis detected by US and MRI on joint/tendon level. Methods Eight hundred forty joints and 700 tendons of 70 consecutive patients, presenting with inflammatory arthritis or clinically suspect arthralgia, underwent US and MRI of MCP (2–5), wrist and MTP (1–5) joints at the same day. Greyscale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) synovitis were scored according to the modified Szkudlarek method (combining synovial effusion and hypertrophy) and the recently published EULAR-OMERACT method (synovial hypertrophy regardless of the presence of effusion) on static images. US-detected tenosynovitis was scored according to the OMERACT. MRI scans were scored according to the RAMRIS. Test characteristics were calculated on joint/tendon level with MRI as reference. Cut-off for US scores were ≥\\u20091 and ≥\\u20092 and for MRI ≥\\u20091. Results Compared to MRI, GS synovitis according to EULAR-OMERACT (cut-off ≥\\u20091) had a sensitivity ranging from 29 to 75% for the different joint locations; specificity ranged from 80 to 98%. For the modified Szkudlarek method, the sensitivity was 68–91% and specificity 52–71%. PD synovitis had a sensitivity of 30–54% and specificity 97–99% compared to MRI. The sensitivity to detect GS tenosynovitis was 50–78% and the specificity 80–94%. For PD tenosynovitis, the sensitivity was 19–58% and specificity 98–100%. Conclusion Current data showed that US is less sensitive than MRI in the early detection of synovitis and tenosynovitis, but resulted in only few non-specific findings. The higher sensitivity of MRI is at the expense of less accessibility and higher costs.

What is the additional value of MRI of the foot to the hand in undifferentiated arthritis to predict rheumatoid arthritis development? Background MRI-detected subclinical joint inflammation in the hand joints of patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) predicts progression to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unknown if adding MRI of the foot increases predictive accuracy compared to the hand alone. Methods 1.5-T contrast-enhanced MRI of the unilateral foot (MTP-1-5) and hand (MCP-2-5 and wrist) was performed in 123 patients presenting with UA (not fulfilling the 2010 RA criteria) and scored for bone marrow edema (BME), synovitis and tenosynovitis. Symptom-free controls (n\\u2009=\\u2009193) served as a reference for defining an abnormal MRI. Patients were followed for RA development ≤\\u20091\\xa0year, defined as fulfilling the classification criteria or initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs because of the expert opinion of RA. The added predictive value of foot MRI to hand MRI was evaluated. Results Fifty-two percent developed RA. Foot tenosynovitis was predictive (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.01–6.43), independent of BME and synovitis (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.03–10.53), but not independent of CRP and number of swollen joints (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.77–5.95). Hand tenosynovitis was also predictive independent of BME and synovitis (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.64–9.69) and independent of CRP and swollen joints (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.04–5.38). Adding foot tenosynovitis to hand tenosynovitis changed the sensitivity from 72 to 73%, specificity from 59 to 54% and AUC from 0.66 to 0.64; the net reclassification index was −\\u20093.5. Conclusion MRI-detected tenosynovitis of the foot predicts progression to RA. However, adding MRI of the foot does not improve the predictive accuracy compared to MRI of the hand alone. In view of cost reduction, the performance of foot MRI for prognostic purposes in UA can be omitted.

ACPA-negative RA consists of subgroups: patients with high likelihood of achieving sustained DMARD-free remission can be identified by serological markers at disease presentation Abstract Background Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-free remission, the sustained absence of synovitis after DMARD cessation, is increasingly achievable, especially in autoantibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, underlying mechanisms are unknown and patient subgroups that achieve this outcome are insufficiently characterized. We evaluated whether serological biomarkers at disease onset, as measured within the multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score, are differently expressed in RA patients who achieve sustained DMARD-free remission. Methods Two hundred ninety-nine RA patients were evaluated for achievement of sustained DMARD-free remission during a median follow-up of 4.3\\u2009years. Twelve biomarkers, as included in the MBDA score, were determined from the serum obtained at disease onset. Patients were categorized as having a low (<\\u200930), moderate (30–44) or high (>\\u200944) score. Analyses were stratified for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) based under the assumption that ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA are different disease entities. Results Twenty percent achieved sustained DMARD-free remission. Overall, high MBDA scores were associated with achieving DMARD-free remission (high vs. low HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2–12.2). Among ACPA-negative RA patients, moderate or high scores associated strongly with DMARD-free remission (moderate vs. low HR 9.4, 95% CI 1.2–72.9; high vs. low HR 9.7, 95% CI 1.3–71.1). This association was independent of age and other clinical factors (high vs. low HR 8.2, 95% CI 1.1–61.8). For ACPA-negative RA patients, the biomarkers C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and matrix metalloproteinase-3 were individually associated with sustained DMARD-free remission. Among ACPA-positive RA patients, scores were not associated with DMARD-free remission. Conclusions ACPA-negative RA patients who achieved sustained DMARD-free remission after treatment withdrawal were characterized by moderate to high MBDA scores at diagnosis. This is the first evidence that ACPA-negative RA can be subdivided in clinically relevant subsets at disease onset using a protein profile. Preclinical effects of APOE ε4 on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 concentrations Background From earlier studies it is known that the APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 polymorphism modulates the concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1–42 (Aβ42) in patients with cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as in cognitively healthy controls. Here, in a large cohort consisting solely of cognitively healthy individuals, we aimed to evaluate how the effect of APOE on CSF Aβ42 varies by age, to understand the association between APOE and the onset of preclinical AD. Methods APOE genotype and CSF Aβ42 concentration were determined in a cohort comprising 716 cognitively healthy individuals aged 17–99 from nine different clinical research centers. Results CSF concentrations of Aβ42 were lower in APOE ε4 carriers than in noncarriers in a gene dose-dependent manner. The effect of APOE ε4 on CSF Aβ42 was age dependent. The age at which CSF Aβ42 concentrations started to decrease was estimated at 50 years in APOE ε4-negative individuals and 43 years in heterozygous APOE ε4 carriers. Homozygous APOE ε4 carriers showed a steady decline in CSF Aβ42 concentrations with increasing age throughout the examined age span. Conclusions People possessing the APOE ε4 allele start to show a decrease in CSF Aβ42 concentration almost a decade before APOE ε4 noncarriers already in early middle age. Homozygous APOE ε4 carriers might deposit Aβ42 throughout the examined age span. These results suggest that there is an APOE ε4-dependent period of early alterations in amyloid homeostasis, when amyloid slowly accumulates, that several years later, together with other downstream pathological events such as tau pathology, translates into cognitive decline. Endo-lysosomal proteins and ubiquitin CSF concentrations in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease Abstract Background Increasing evidence implicates dysfunctional proteostasis and the involvement of the autophagic and endo-lysosomal system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles within the neurons. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), susceptibility has been linked to genes encoding proteins involved in autophagy and lysosomal function, as well as mutations causing lysosomal disorders. Furthermore, both diseases are characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates. Methods Proteins associated with endocytosis, lysosomal function, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and targeted by combining solid-phase extraction and parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. In total, 50 peptides from 18 proteins were quantified in three cross-sectional cohorts including AD (N\\u2009=\\u200961), PD (N\\u2009=\\u200921), prodromal AD (N\\u2009=\\u200910), stable mild cognitive impairment (N\\u2009=\\u200915), and controls (N\\u2009=\\u200968). Results A pilot study, including subjects selected based on their AD CSF core biomarker concentrations, showed increased concentrations of several targeted proteins in subjects with core biomarker levels indicating AD pathology compared to controls. Next, in a clinically characterized cohort, lower concentrations in CSF of proteins in PD were found compared to subjects with prodromal AD. Further investigation in an additional clinical study again revealed lower concentrations in CSF of proteins in PD compared to controls and AD. Conclusion In summary, significantly different peptide CSF concentrations were identified from proteins AP2B1, C9, CTSB, CTSF, GM2A, LAMP1, LAMP2, TCN2, and ubiquitin. Proteins found to have altered concentrations in more than one study were AP2B1, CTSB, CTSF, GM2A, LAMP2, and ubiquitin. Interestingly, given the genetic implication of lysosomal function in PD, we did identify the CSF concentrations of CTSB, CTSF, GM2A, and LAMP2 to be altered. However, we also found differences in proteins associated with endocytosis (AP2B1) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitin). No difference in any peptide CSF concentration was found in clinically characterized subjects with AD compared to controls. In conclusion, CSF analyses of subjects with PD suggest a general lysosomal dysfunction, which resonates well with recent genetic findings, while such changes are minor or absent in AD. Quantification of total apolipoprotein E and its isoforms in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with neurodegenerative diseases Abstract Background The human APOE gene, which codes for apolipoprotein E (apoE), has three major polymorphic alleles: ε2, ε3, and ε4 that give rise to amino acid substitutions. APOE-ε4 is a strong risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the reason why is still unknown despite intense research for more than 20\\u2009years. The aim of the study was to investigate if the concentrations of total apoE and the specific apoE isoforms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differ between various neurodegenerative diseases and control individuals, as well as among the APOE genotypes. Methods Quantification of total apoE and specific apoE isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) in CSF was performed using high-resolution parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. In total, 1820 individuals were involved in the study including clinically diagnosed AD patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009228), cognitively unimpaired (CU) patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009896), and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders (n\\u2009=\\u2009696). Follow-up data was available for 100 individuals, assessed at two time points. Subjects were dichotomized based on an Aβ42/40 CSF concentration ratio cut-off into Aβ positive (Aβ+, <\\u20090.091) and Aβ negative (Aβ−, >\\u20090.091) groups. Results Even though there was a significant increase of total apoE in the amyloid β-positive (Aβ+) group compared with amyloid β-negative (Aβ−) individuals (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), the magnitude of the effect was very small (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.55). Moreover, CSF total apoE concentrations did not differ between Aβ− CU controls and clinically diagnosed AD patients. There was a difference in concentration between isoforms in heterozygous individuals in an isoform-dependent manner (E2\\u2009<\\u2009E3\\u2009<\\u2009E4) (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.64–0.69), and these associations remained when dichotomizing the samples into Aβ+ and Aβ− groups (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.63–0.74). In the cohort with follow-up samples, neither total apoE nor isoform-specific apoE concentrations differed between the two time points (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Conclusions The results indicate that neither the concentrations of total apoE nor the different apoE isoforms in CSF are associated with APOE-ε4 carrier status, Aβ status, or clinical dementia diagnoses. Mining, analyzing, and integrating viral signals from metagenomic data Background Viruses are important components of microbial communities modulating community structure and function; however, only a couple of tools are currently available for phage identification and analysis from metagenomic sequencing data. Here we employed the random forest algorithm to develop VirMiner, a web-based phage contig prediction tool especially sensitive for high-abundances phage contigs, trained and validated by paired metagenomic and phagenomic sequencing data from the human gut flora. Results VirMiner achieved 41.06%\\u2009±\\u200917.51% sensitivity and 81.91%\\u2009±\\u20094.04% specificity in the prediction of phage contigs. In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23%\\u2009±\\u200916.94%) than VirFinder (34.63%\\u2009±\\u200917.96%) and VirSorter (18.75%\\u2009±\\u200915.23%) at almost the same specificity. Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control). Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport. The VirMiner webserver is available at http://sbb.hku.hk/VirMiner/. Conclusions We developed a comprehensive tool for phage prediction and analysis for metagenomic samples. Compared to VirSorter and VirFinder—the most widely used tools—VirMiner is able to capture more high-abundance phage contigs which could play key roles in infecting bacteria and modulating microbial community dynamics.

Stable distinct core eukaryotic viromes in different mosquito species from Guadeloupe, using single mosquito viral metagenomics Background Mosquitoes are the most important invertebrate viral vectors in humans and harbor a high diversity of understudied viruses, which has been shown in many mosquito virome studies in recent years. These studies generally performed metagenomics sequencing on pools of mosquitoes, without assessment of the viral diversity in individual mosquitoes. To address this issue, we applied our optimized viral metagenomics protocol (NetoVIR) to compare the virome of single and pooled Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected from different locations in Guadeloupe, in 2016 and 2017. Results The total read number and viral reads proportion of samples containing a single mosquito have no significant difference compared with those of pools containing five mosquitoes, which proved the feasibility of using single mosquito for viral metagenomics. A comparative analysis of the virome revealed a higher abundance and more diverse eukaryotic virome in Aedes aegypti, whereas Culex quinquefasciatus harbors a richer and more diverse phageome. The majority of the identified eukaryotic viruses were mosquito-species specific. We further characterized the genomes of 11 novel eukaryotic viruses. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of the six most abundant eukaryotic viruses indicated that the majority of individual mosquitoes were infected by several of the selected viruses with viral genome copies per mosquito ranging from 267 to 1.01\\u2009×\\u2009108 (median 7.5\\u2009×\\u2009106) for Ae. aegypti and 192 to 8.69\\u2009×\\u2009106 (median 4.87\\u2009×\\u2009104) for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, in Cx. quinquefasciatus, a number of phage contigs co-occurred with several marker genes of Wolbachia sp. strain wPip. Conclusions We firstly demonstrate the feasibility to use single mosquito for viral metagenomics, which can provide much more precise virome profiles of mosquito populations. Interspecific comparisons show striking differences in abundance and diversity between the viromes of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Those two mosquito species seem to have their own relatively stable \"core eukaryotic virome\", which might have important implications for the competence to transmit important medically relevant arboviruses. The presence of Wolbachia in Cx. quinquefasciatus might explain (1) the lower overall viral load compared to Ae. aegypti, (2) the identification of multiple unknown phage contigs, and (3) the difference in competence for important human pathogens. How these viruses, phages, and bacteria influence the physiology and vector competence of mosquito hosts warrants further research.

Integrating rare genetic variants into pharmacogenetic drug response predictions Background Variability in genes implicated in drug pharmacokinetics or drug response can modulate treatment efficacy or predispose to adverse drug reactions. Besides common genetic polymorphisms, recent sequencing projects revealed a plethora of rare genetic variants in genes encoding proteins involved in drug metabolism, transport, and response. Results To understand the global importance of rare pharmacogenetic gene variants, we mapped the variability in 208 pharmacogenes by analyzing exome sequencing data from 60,706 unrelated individuals and estimated the importance of rare and common genetic variants using a computational prediction framework optimized for pharmacogenetic assessments. Our analyses reveal that rare pharmacogenetic variants were strongly enriched in mutations predicted to cause functional alterations. For more than half of the pharmacogenes, rare variants account for the entire genetic variability. Each individual harbored on average a total of 40.6 putatively functional variants, rare variants accounting for 10.8% of these. Overall, the contribution of rare variants was found to be highly gene- and drug-specific. Using warfarin, simvastatin, voriconazole, olanzapine, and irinotecan as examples, we conclude that rare genetic variants likely account for a substantial part of the unexplained inter-individual differences in drug metabolism phenotypes. Conclusions Combined, our data reveal high gene and drug specificity in the contributions of rare variants. We provide a proof-of-concept on how this information can be utilized to pinpoint genes for which sequencing-based genotyping can add important information to predict drug response, which provides useful information for the design of clinical trials in drug development and the personalization of pharmacological treatment.

Impact of ZBTB7A hypomethylation and expression patterns on treatment response to hydroxyurea Background We aimed to clarify the emerging epigenetic landscape in a group of genes classified as “modifier genes” of the β-type globin genes (HBB cluster), known to operate in trans to accomplish the two natural developmental switches in globin expression, from embryonic to fetal during the first trimester of conception and from fetal to adult around the time of birth. The epigenetic alterations were determined in adult sickle cell anemia (SCA) homozygotes and SCA/β-thalassemia compound heterozygotes of Greek origin, who are under hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Patients were distinguished in HU responders and HU non-responders (those not benefited from the HU) and both, and in vivo and in vitro approaches were implemented. Results We examined the CpG islands’ DNA methylation profile of BCL11A, KLF1, MYB, MAP3K5, SIN3A, ZBTB7A, and GATA2, along with γ-globin and LRF/ZBTB7A expression levels. In vitro treatment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with HU induced a significant DNA hypomethylation pattern in ZBTB7A (p*, 0.04) and GATA2 (p*, 0.03) CpGs exclusively in the HU non-responders. Also, this group of patients exhibited significantly elevated baseline methylation patterns in ZBTB7A, before the HU treatment, compared to HU responders (p*, 0.019) and to control group of healthy individuals (p*, 0.021), which resembles a potential epigenetic barrier for the γ-globin expression. γ-Globin expression in vitro matched with detected HbF levels during patients’ monitoring tests (in vivo) under HU treatment, implying a good reproducibility of the in vitro HU epigenetic effect. LRF/ZBTB7A expression was elevated only in the HU non-responders under the influence of HU. Conclusions This is one of the very first pharmacoepigenomic studies indicating that the hypomethylation of ZBTB7A during HU treatment enhances the LRF expression, which by its turn suppresses the HbF resumption in the HU non-responders. Its role as an epigenetic regulator of hemoglobin switching is also supported by the wide distribution of ZBTB7A-binding sites within the 5′ CpG sequences of all studied human HBB cluster “modifier genes.” Also, the baseline methylation level of selective CpGs in ZBTB7A and GATA2 could be an indicator of the negative HU response among the β-type hemoglobinopathy patients.

Praziquantel decreases fecundity in Schistosoma mansoni adult worms that survive treatment: evidence from a laboratory life-history trade-offs selection study Background Mass drug administration of praziquantel is the World Health Organization’s endorsed control strategy for schistosomiasis. A decade of annual treatments across sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in significant reductions of infection prevalence and intensity levels, although ‘hotspots’ remain. Repeated drug treatments place strong selective pressures on parasites, which may affect life-history traits that impact transmission dynamics. Understanding drug treatment responses and the evolution of such traits can help inform on how to minimise the risk of drug resistance developing, maximise sustainable control programme success, and improve diagnostic protocols. Methods We performed a four-generation Schistosoma mansoni praziquantel selection experiment in mice and snails. We used three\\xa0S. mansoni lines: a\\xa0praziquantel-resistant isolate\\xa0(R), a\\xa0praziquantel-susceptible\\xa0isolate (S), and a co-infected line (RS), under three treatment regimens: untreated, 25\\xa0mg/kg praziquantel, or 50\\xa0mg/kg praziquantel. Life-history traits, including parasite adult-worm establishment, survival, reproduction (fecundity), and associated morbidity, were recorded in mice across all four generations. Predictor variables were tested in a series of generalized linear mixed effects models to determine which factors had a significant influence on parasite life-history traits in definitive hosts under different selection regimes. Results Praziquantel pressure significantly reduced adult-worm burdens across all generations and isolates, including within R-lines. However, previous drug treatment resulted in an increase in adult-worm establishment with increasing generation from P1 to F3. The highest worm numbers were in the co-infected RS line. Praziquantel treatment decreased adult-worm burden, but had a larger negative impact on the mean daily number of miracidia, a proxy for fecundity, across all three parasite isolates. Conclusions Our predicted cost of resistance was not supported by the traits we measured within the murine host. We did not find evidence for negative adult worm density-dependent effects on fecundity. In contrast, of the adult worms that survived treatment, even low doses of praziquantel significantly reduced adult-worm fecundity. Such reductions in worm fecundity post treatment suggest that egg - based measures of drug efficacy, such as Kato-Katz, may overestimate the short-term effect of praziquantel on adult - worm burdens. These findings have important implications for S. mansoni transmission control, diagnostic protocols, and the potential for undetected selection toward drug resistance.

Quantitative analysis of human endogenous retrovirus-K transcripts in postmortem premotor cortex fails to confirm elevated expression of HERV-K RNA in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Over the past two decades a number of studies have demonstrated activity of the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase in the serum of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Known human exogenous retroviruses such as HIV-1 have been eliminated as possible sources of this activity and investigators have therefore considered the possibility that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) might be involved. HERV-K (HML-2) is the most recent retroviral candidate to be proposed following the observation of elevated HERV-K expression in cortical and spinal neurons of ALS patients and the demonstration of HERV-K envelope protein neurotoxicity in vitro and in transgenic mice. This retroviral hypothesis is an attractive one, not least because it raises the possibility that ALS might become treatable using antiretroviral drugs. In the present study we have attempted independent confirmation of the observation that HERV-K RNA levels are elevated in ALS brain. Total RNA was extracted from the postmortem premotor cortex of 34 patients with ALS and 23 controls. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed according to the MIQE guidelines using HERV-K gag, pol and env primer sets. Data was analysed by the 2-∆∆Ct method with normalisation against two reference genes, GAPDH and XPNPEP1. Geometric mean HERV-K RNA expression levels in the premotor cortex of ALS patients were not found to be different from the expression levels in non-ALS controls. Our findings do not confirm the recently reported association between elevated cortical HERV-K RNA levels and ALS, and thus raise doubts about the role of this endogenous retrovirus in ALS pathogenesis. The results of this study may have implications for ongoing clinical trials aiming to suppress HERV-K activity with antiretroviral drugs.

C9orf72 intermediate expansions of 24–30 repeats are associated with ALS The expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in C9orf72 is the most common known cause of ALS accounting for ~\\u200940% familial cases and ~\\u20097% sporadic cases in the European population. In most people, the repeat length is 2, but in people with ALS, hundreds to thousands of repeats may be observed. A small proportion of people have an intermediate expansion, of the order of 20 to 30 repeats in size, and it remains unknown whether intermediate expansions confer risk of ALS in the same way that massive expansions do. We investigated the association of this intermediate repeat with ALS by performing a meta-analysis of four previously published studies and a new British/Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset of 1295 cases and 613 controls. The final dataset comprised 5071 cases and 3747 controls. Our meta-analysis showed association between ALS and intermediate C9orf72 repeats of 24 to 30 repeats in size (random-effects model OR\\u2009=\\u20094.2, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20091.23–14.35, p-value\\u2009=\\u20090.02). Furthermore, we showed a different frequency of the repeat between the northern and southern European populations (Fisher’s exact test p-value\\u2009=\\u20095\\u2009×\\u200910−\\u20093). Our findings provide evidence for the association between intermediate repeats and ALS (p-value\\u2009=\\u20092\\u2009×\\u200910−\\u20094) with direct relevance for research and clinical practice by showing that an expansion of 24 or more repeats should be considered pathogenic.

Quantification of liver fibrosis: extracellular volume fraction using an MRI bolus-only technique in a rat animal model BACKGROUND: To determine the utility of single-contrast-bolus hepatic extracellular volume (ECV) fraction measurement at different time points to detect and quantify hepatic fibrosis.METHODS: Different grades of liver fibrosis were induced in 23 male Sprague-Dawley rats by carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) intoxication. In ten control rats, no fibrosis was induced. Native T1 values and ECV fraction were assessed by using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mapping; only one contrast bolus was applied (gadobutrol 0.1\\u2009mmol/kg). ECV values were determined 5, 15, and 25\\u2009min after injection. Hepatic fibrosis was quantified histologically by Sirius red staining.RESULTS: For the 8-week-CCl4 group, the ECV fraction values obtained 5 (23.5\\u2009±\\u20094.8%, mean\\u2009±\\u2009standard deviation), 15 (23.6\\u2009±\\u20094.8%), and 25\\u2009min (23.7\\u2009±\\u20094.7%) after injection were constant over time (p\\u2009=\\u20090.998); constant data 5-25\\u2009min after injection were also observed for the 16-week-CCl4 group and controls. Liver ECV after 15\\u2009min significantly increased with the severity of fibrosis: 18.0\\u2009±\\u20093.0% (controls) versus 23.6\\u2009±\\u20094.8% (8-week-CCl4) versus 30.5\\u2009±\\u20093.3% (16-week-CCl4) (p\\u2009<\\u2009 0.001). ECV values after 5, 15, and 25\\u2009min significantly correlated with Sirius red staining (p\\u2009<\\u2009 0.001 for all parameters).CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic ECV obtained using a single-contrast-bolus technique can be measured 5, 15, and 25\\u2009min after injection, obtaining constant values over time, each of them being suitable to detect diffuse hepatic fibrosis. In clinical practice, post-contrast T1 relaxation times for liver ECV fraction determination might be obtained at only one time point. Neurofilament light in CSF and serum is a sensitive marker for axonal white matter injury in MS Objective: In an ongoing, open-label, phase 1b study on the intrathecal administration of rituximab for progressive multiple sclerosis, an intraventricular catheter was inserted for drug delivery. The objective of this study was to characterize the limited white matter axonal injury evoked by catheter insertion by analyzing a panel of markers for tissue damage in CSF and serum. Methods: Lumbar CSF and serum were collected before catheter insertion and at regular intervals during the follow-up period of 1 year. Levels of neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein, microtubule-associated protein tau, and S100 calcium binding protein B were measured in the CSF, and NF-L was also quantified in serum at each time point. Results: One month after neurosurgical trauma, there was a distinct peak in NF-L concentration in both CSF and serum. In contrast, the biomarkers S100 calcium binding protein B, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and microtubule-associated protein tau did not show any significant changes. NF-L levels in both CSF and serum peaked at 1 month post surgery, returning to baseline after 6 to 9 months. A strong correlation was observed between the concentrations of NF-L in CSF and serum. Conclusions: The NF-L level, in CSF and serum, appears to be both a sensitive and specific marker for white matter axonal injury. This makes NF-L a valuable tool with which to evaluate acute white matter axonal damage in a clinical setting. Serum analysis of NF-L may become a convenient way to follow white matter axonal damage longitudinally. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01719159. CSF parameters associated with early MRI activity in patients with MS Objective To identify CSF parameters at diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and MS that are associated with early inflammatory disease activity as measured by standardized cerebral MRI (cMRI). Methods One hundred forty-nine patients with newly diagnosed CIS and MS were included in the retrospective study. cMRI at onset and after 12 months was analyzed for T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions. CSF was tested for oligoclonal bands and intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G (IgG), A (IgA), and M (IgM) before initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). In a subgroup of patients, CSF and serum samples were analyzed for sCD27, neurofilament light chain, and IgG subclasses 1 and 3. Association between CSF parameters and cMRI activity was investigated by univariable and multivariable regression analysis in all patients, DMT-treated patients, and untreated patients. Results IgG index, sCD27 levels in CSF, and to a lesser extent IgM index were associated with the occurrence of new cMRI lesions. IgG index and sCD27 levels in CSF were highly correlated. In a multivariable analysis, IgG index and to a lesser extent IgM index together with DMT treatment status and gender were strongest predictors of future cMRI activity. Conclusions CSF parameters such as IgG and IgM index are independently associated with future MRI activity and thus might be helpful to support early treatment decisions in patients newly diagnosed with CIS and MS. Blood-based NfL Objective: To determine if blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein can discriminate between Parkinson disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD) with equally high diagnostic accuracy as CSF NfL, and can therefore improve the diagnostic workup of parkinsonian disorders. Methods: The study included 3 independent prospective cohorts: the Lund (n = 278) and London (n = 117) cohorts, comprising healthy controls and patients with PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), as well as an early disease cohort (n = 109) of patients with PD, PSP, MSA, or CBS with disease duration ≤3 years. Blood NfL concentration was measured using an ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) method, and the diagnostic accuracy to distinguish PD from APD was investigated. Results: We found strong correlations between blood and CSF concentrations of NfL (ρ ≥ 0.73–0.84, p ≤ 0.001). Blood NfL was increased in patients with MSA, PSP, and CBS (i.e., all APD groups) when compared to patients with PD as well as healthy controls in all cohorts (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in the Lund cohort, blood NfL could accurately distinguish PD from APD (area under the curve [AUC] 0.91) with similar results in both the London cohort (AUC 0.85) and the early disease cohort (AUC 0.81). Conclusions: Quantification of blood NfL concentration can be used to distinguish PD from APD. Blood-based NfL might consequently be included in the diagnostic workup of patients with parkinsonian symptoms in both primary care and specialized clinics. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that blood NfL levels discriminate between PD and APD. Genetic testing in ALS Objective: To determine the degree of consensus among clinicians on the clinical use of genetic testing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the factors that determine decision-making. Methods: ALS researchers worldwide were invited to participate in a detailed online survey to determine their attitudes and practices relating to genetic testing. Results: Responses from 167 clinicians from 21 different countries were analyzed. The majority of respondents (73.3%) do not consider that there is a consensus definition of familial ALS (FALS). Fifty-seven percent consider a family history of frontotemporal dementia and 48.5% the presence of a known ALS genetic mutation as sufficient for a diagnosis of FALS. Most respondents (90.2%) offer genetic testing to patients they define as having FALS and 49.4% to patients with sporadic ALS. Four main genes (SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS) are commonly tested. A total of 55.2% of respondents would seek genetic testing if they had personally received a diagnosis of ALS. Forty-two percent never offer presymptomatic testing to family members of patients with FALS. Responses varied between ALS specialists and nonspecialists and based on the number of new patients seen per year. Conclusions: There is a lack of consensus among clinicians as to the definition of FALS. Substantial variation exists in attitude and practices related to genetic testing of patients and presymptomatic testing of their relatives across geographic regions and between experienced specialists in ALS and nonspecialists. Serum neurofilament light as a biomarker for mild traumatic brain injury in contact sports Objective: To evaluate whether the axonal protein neurofilament light (NFL) in serum is a sensitive biomarker to detect subtle brain injury or concussion in contact sports athletes. Methods: Two prospective cohort studies involving (1) 14 Swedish amateur boxers who underwent fluid biomarker assessments at 7–10 days after bout and after 3 months of rest from boxing and (2) 35 Swedish professional hockey players who underwent blood biomarker assessment at 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after concussion and when the players returned to play were performed. Fourteen healthy nonathletic controls and 12 athletic controls were also enrolled. Serum NFL was measured using ultrasensitive single molecule array technology. Results: Serum NFL concentrations were increased in boxers 7–10 days after bout as compared to the levels after 3 months rest as well as compared with controls (p = 0.0007 and p < 0.0001, respectively). NFL decreased following 3 months of rest, but was still higher than in controls (p < 0.0001). Boxers who received many (>15) hits to the head or were groggy after bout had higher concentrations of serum NFL as compared to those who received fewer hits to the head (p = 0.0023). Serum NFL increased over time in hockey players, and the levels returned to normal at return to play. Importantly, serum NFL could separate players with rapidly resolving postconcussion symptoms (PCS) from those with prolonged PCS. Conclusions: The results from these 2 independent cohort studies suggest that serum NFL is a highly sensitive biomarker for concussion. Meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic interactions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical trials Objective: To assess whether genetic subgroups in recent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) trials responded to treatment with lithium carbonate, but that the treatment effect was lost in a large cohort of nonresponders. Methods: Individual participant data were obtained from 3 randomized trials investigating the efficacy of lithium carbonate. We matched clinical data with data regarding the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype. Our primary outcome was survival at 12 months. On an exploratory basis, we assessed whether the effect of lithium depended on the genotype. Results: Clinical data were available for 518 of the 606 participants. Overall, treatment with lithium carbonate did not improve 12-month survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7–1.4; p = 0.96). Both the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype were independent predictors of survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.3; p = 0.006 and HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.2; p = 0.032, respectively). The effect of lithium was different for UNC13A carriers (p = 0.027), but not for C9orf72 carriers (p = 0.22). The 12-month survival probability for UNC13A carriers treated with lithium carbonate improved from 40.1% (95% CI 23.2–69.1) to 69.7% (95% CI 50.4–96.3). Conclusions: This study incorporated genetic data into past ALS trials to determine treatment effects in a genetic post hoc analysis. Our results suggest that we should reorient our strategies toward finding treatments for ALS, start focusing on genotype-targeted treatments, and standardize genotyping in order to optimize randomization and analysis for future clinical trials. Neurofilament light and tau as blood biomarkers for sports-related concussion Objective To compare neurofilament light (NfL) and tau as blood-based biomarkers for acute sports-related concussion (SRC) and determine whether their concentrations at different time points after the injury are associated with prolonged time to return to play (RTP). Methods A total of 288 professional hockey players were followed longitudinally from September 1, 2012, to April 30, 2015. Data collection and biomarker analyses were conducted between 2015 and 2017. Associations were tested between blood concentrations of NfL and tau, and RTP time. Serum concentrations of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were also measured for comparison. Results Of 288 players, 105 sustained an SRC. Of these, 87 underwent blood sampling 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after SRC and at the RTP time point. Serum NfL concentrations 1, 12, 36, and 144 hours after SRC were related to prolonged RTP time, and could separate players with RTP >10 days from those with RTP ≤10 days (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.82). Also, serum NfL 144 hours after SRC discriminated players who resigned from the game due to persistent postconcussion symptoms (PCS) from those who returned to play (AUROC 0.89). Plasma tau 1 hour after SRC was related to RTP but less strongly than NfL, while S100B and NSE showed no such associations. Conclusion Serum NfL outperformed tau, S100B, and NSE as a biomarker for SRC. From a clinical standpoint, serum NfL may be useful to identify individuals at risk of prolonged PCS, and may aid in biomarker-informed decisions with regard to when RTP should be considered. Neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and gliosis are phenotypic of Alzheimer dementia Objective To test the hypothesis that cognitively unimpaired individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology differ from individuals with AD dementia on biomarkers of neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and glial activation. Methods In a cross-sectional study, adult participants >70 years old (n = 79, age 77.1 ± 5.3 years) underwent comprehensive cognitive evaluation and CSF collection, which was assayed for markers of amyloid, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light protein [NFL] and total tau), synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), and glial activation (chitinase-3–like protein 1 [YKL-40]). Participants were divided into 3 groups based on diagnosis and p-tau/β-amyloid42 (Aβ42): those with low p-tau/Aβ42 and unimpaired cognition were classified as controls (n = 25); those with high p-tau/Aβ42 diagnosed with AD-dementia or AD–mild cognitive impairment were classified as AD-Dementia (n = 40); and those with high p-tau/Aβ42 but unimpaired cognition were classified as mismatches (n = 14). A similar, secondary analysis was performed with no age exclusion criteria (n = 411). Results In both the primary and secondary analyses, biomarker levels between groups were compared with the use of analysis of covariance while controlling for age and demographic variables. Despite p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 levels comparable to those of the AD-Dementia group, mismatches had significantly lower levels of NFL and total tau. While not significantly lower than the AD-Dementia group on YKL-40 and neurogranin, mismatches were also not significantly different from controls. Conclusions These results provide evidence that, in the absence of significant neurodegenerative processes, individuals who harbor AD neuropathology may remain cognitively unimpaired. This finding provides insight into the biological processes phenotypic of dementia and supports monitoring multiple biomarkers in individuals positive for AD neuropathology. ALS-specific cognitive and behavior changes associated with advancing disease stage in ALS ObjectiveTo elucidate the relationship between disease stage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as measured with the King\\'s Clinical Staging System, and cognitive and behavioral change, measured with the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS).MethodsA large multicenter observational cohort of 161 cross-sectional patients with ALS and 80 healthy matched controls were recruited across 3 research sites (Dublin, Edinburgh, and London). Participants were administered the ECAS and categorized into independent groups based on their King\\'s clinical disease stage at time of testing.ResultsSignificant differences were observed between patients and controls on all subtests of the ECAS except for visuospatial functioning. A significant cross-sectional effect was observed across disease stages for ALS-specific functions (executive, language, letter fluency) and ECAS total score but not for ALS-nonspecific functions (memory, visuospatial). Rates of ALS-specific impairment and behavioral change were also related to disease stage. The relationship between cognitive function and disease stage may be due to letter fluency impairment, whereas higher rates of all behavioral domains were seen in later King\\'s stage. The presence of bulbar signs, but not site of onset, was significantly related to ALS-specific, ECAS total, and behavioral scores.ConclusionALS-specific cognitive deficits and behavioral impairment are more frequent with more severe disease stage. By end-stage disease, only a small percentage of patients are free of neuropsychological impairment. The presence of bulbar symptoms exaggerates the differences observed between disease stages. These findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral change should be incorporated into ALS diagnostic criteria and should be included in future staging systems. A large case-control study on vaccination as risk factor for multiple sclerosis Objective To investigate the hypothesis that vaccination is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) by use of German ambulatory claims data in a case-control study. Methods Using the ambulatory claims data of the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians covering 2005–2017, logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between MS (n = 12,262) and vaccinations in the 5 years before first diagnosis. Participants newly diagnosed with Crohn disease (n = 19,296) or psoriasis (n = 112,292) and participants with no history of these autoimmune diseases (n = 79,185) served as controls. Results The odds of MS were lower in participants with a recorded vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 0.870, p < 0.001 vs participants without autoimmune disease; OR 0.919, p < 0.001 vs participants with Crohn disease; OR 0.973, p = 0.177 vs participants with psoriasis). Lower odds were most pronounced for vaccinations against influenza and tick-borne encephalitis. These effects were consistently observed for different time frames, control cohorts, and definitions of the MS cohort. Effect sizes increased toward the time of first diagnosis. Conclusions Results of the present study do not reveal vaccination to be a risk factor for MS. On the contrary, they consistently suggest that vaccination is associated with a lower likelihood of being diagnosed with MS within the next 5 years. Whether this is a protective effect needs to be addressed by future studies. Blood neurofilament light levels segregate treatment effects in multiple sclerosis Objective To determine factors (including the role of specific disease modulatory treatments [DMTs]) associated with (1) baseline, (2) on-treatment, and (3) change (from treatment start to on-treatment assessment) in plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) concentrations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data including blood samples analyses and long-term clinical follow-up information for 1,261 Swedish patients with RRMS starting novel DMTs were analyzed using linear regressions to model pNfL and changes in pNfL concentrations as a function of clinical variables and DMTs (alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, natalizumab, rituximab, and teriflunomide). Results The baseline pNfL concentration was positively associated with relapse rate, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, Age-Related MS Severity Score, and MS Impact Score (MSIS-29), and negatively associated with Symbol Digit Modalities Test performance and the number of previously used DMTs. All analyses, which used inverse propensity score weighting to correct for differences in baseline factors at DMT start, highlighted that both the reduction in pNfL concentration from baseline to on-treatment measurement and the on-treatment pNfL level differed across DMTs. Patients starting alemtuzumab displayed the highest reduction in pNfL concentration and lowest on-treatment pNfL concentrations, while those starting teriflunomide had the smallest decrease and highest on-treatment levels, but also starting from lower values. Both on-treatment pNfL and decrease in pNfL concentrations were highly dependent on baseline concentrations. Conclusion Choice of DMT in RRMS is significantly associated with degree of reduction in pNfL, which supports a role for pNfL as a drug response marker. Sexual dimorphism in the width of the mouse synaptonemal complex Sexual dimorphism has been used to describe morphological differences between the sexes, but can be extended to any biologically related process that varies between males and females. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a tripartite structure that connects homologous chromosomes in meiosis. Here, aided by super-resolution microscopy techniques, we show that the SC is subject to sexual dimorphism, in mouse germ cells. We have identified a significantly narrower SC in oocytes and have established that this difference does not arise from a different organization of the lateral elements nor from a different isoform of transverse filament protein SYCP1. Instead, we provide evidence for the existence of a narrower central element and a different integration site for the C-termini of SYCP1, in females. In addition to these female-specific features, we speculate that post-translation modifications affecting the SYCP1 coiled-coil region could render a more compact conformation, thus contributing to the narrower SC observed in females. Recent advances in rhythm control for atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a difficult management problem. The restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm—rhythm control therapy—can markedly improve symptoms and haemodynamics for patients who have paroxysmal or persistent AF, but some patients fare well with rate control alone. Sinus rhythm can be achieved with anti-arrhythmic drugs or electrical cardioversion, but the maintenance of sinus rhythm without recurrence is more challenging. Catheter ablation of the AF triggers is more effective than anti-arrhythmic drugs at maintaining sinus rhythm. Whilst pulmonary vein isolation is an effective strategy, other ablation targets are being evaluated to improve sinus rhythm maintenance, especially in patients with chronic forms of AF. Previously extensive ablation strategies have been used for patients with persistent AF, but a recent trial has shown that pulmonary vein isolation without additional ablation lesions is associated with outcomes similar to those of more extensive ablation. This has led to an increase in catheter-based technology to achieve durable pulmonary vein isolation. Furthermore, a combination of anti-arrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation seems useful to improve the effectiveness of rhythm control therapy. Two large ongoing trials evaluate whether a modern rhythm control therapy can improve prognosis in patients with AF. Managing portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis Portal hypertension is one cause and a part of a dynamic process triggered by chronic liver disease, mostly induced by alcohol or incorrect nutrition and less often by viral infections and autoimmune or genetic disease. Adequate staging - continuously modified by current knowledge - should guide the prevention and treatment of portal hypertension with defined endpoints. The main goals are interruption of etiology and prevention of complications followed, if necessary, by treatment of these. For the past few decades, shunts, mostly as intrahepatic stent bypass between portal and hepatic vein branches, have played an important role in the prevention of recurrent bleeding and ascites formation, although their impact on survival remains ambiguous. Systemic drugs, such as non-selective beta-blockers, statins, or antibiotics, reduce portal hypertension by decreasing intrahepatic resistance or portal tributary blood flow or by blunting inflammatory stimuli inside and outside the liver. Here, the interactions among the gut, liver, and brain are increasingly examined for new therapeutic options. There is no general panacea. The interruption of initiating factors is key. If not possible or if not possible in a timely manner, combined approaches should receive more attention before considering liver transplantation. Disentangling metabolic functions of bacteria in the honey bee gut It is presently unclear how much individual community members contribute to the overall metabolic output of a gut microbiota. To address this question, we used the honey bee, which harbors a relatively simple and remarkably conserved gut microbiota with striking parallels to the mammalian system and importance for bee health. Using untargeted metabolomics, we profiled metabolic changes in gnotobiotic bees that were colonized with the complete microbiota reconstituted from cultured strains. We then determined the contribution of individual community members in mono-colonized bees and recapitulated our findings using in vitro cultures. Our results show that the honey bee gut microbiota utilizes a wide range of pollen-derived substrates, including flavonoids and outer pollen wall components, suggesting a key role for degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites and pollen digestion. In turn, multiple species were responsible for the accumulation of organic acids and aromatic compound degradation intermediates. Moreover, a specific gut symbiont, Bifidobacterium asteroides, stimulated the production of host hormones known to impact bee development. While we found evidence for cross-feeding interactions, approximately 80% of the identified metabolic changes were also observed in mono-colonized bees, with Lactobacilli being responsible for the largest share of the metabolic output. These results show that, despite prolonged evolutionary associations, honey bee gut bacteria can independently establish and metabolize a wide range of compounds in the gut. Our study reveals diverse bacterial functions that are likely to contribute to bee health and provide fundamental insights into how metabolic activities are partitioned within gut communities. Dynamics and heterogeneity of brain damage in multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease driving inflammatory and degenerative processes that damage the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is not well understood how these events interact and evolve to evoke such a highly dynamic and heterogeneous disease. We established a hypothesis whereby the variability in the course of MS is driven by the very same pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease, the autoimmune attack on the CNS that leads to chronic inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration and remyelination. We propose that each of these processes acts more or less severely and at different times in each of the clinical subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that was constrained by experimental data (the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] time series) obtained from a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 66 MS patients with a long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Moreover, we validated this model in a second prospective cohort of 120 MS patients with a three-year follow-up, for which EDSS data and brain volume time series were available. The clinical heterogeneity in the datasets was reduced by grouping the EDSS time series using an unsupervised clustering analysis. We found that by adjusting certain parameters, albeit within their biological range, the mathematical model reproduced the different disease courses, supporting the dynamic CNS damage hypothesis to explain MS heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests that the irreversible axon degeneration produced in the early stages of progressive MS is mainly due to the higher rate of myelinated axon degeneration, coupled to the lower capacity for remyelination. However, and in agreement with recent pathological studies, degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is not a key feature that distinguishes this phenotype. Moreover, the model reveals that lower rates of axon degeneration and more rapid remyelination make relapsing MS more resilient than the progressive subtype. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis for the different MS subtypes, even in the presence of genetic and environmental heterogeneity. Hence, MS can be considered as a single disease in which specific dynamics can provoke a variety of clinical outcomes in different patient groups. These results have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions for MS at different stages of the disease. DeepWAS: Multivariate genotype-phenotype associations by directly integrating regulatory information using deep learning Author summary In the era of steadily increasing amounts of available genetic data, we still lack novel and innovative ideas on how to improve fine-mapping of regulatory variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), especially in non-coding regions. Current approaches for the identification of functional variants conduct functional annotation after the GWAS analysis either using position-based overlaps of each variant with regulatory elements or deep-learning-based methods predicting regulatory effects per variant on cell-type-specific chromatin features. We here present DeepWAS, which integrates these regulatory effect predictions of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. Our results provide evidence that DeepWAS results directly identify disease/trait-associated SNPs with a common effect on a specific chromatin feature in a relevant tissue. We can show for multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, and body height, that the SNPs identified by DeepWAS are at least nominally significant in classical univariate GWAS analysis of the same cohorts or larger published GWAS. By integrating expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL and meQTL) information of multiple resources and tissues, we can show that DeepWAS identifies disease/trait-relevant transcriptionally active genomic loci. We demonstrate that DeepWAS identifies both known variants and highlights underlying molecular mechanisms. The influence of red blood cell deformability on hematocrit profiles and platelet margination The influence of red blood cell (RBC) deformability in whole blood on platelet margination is investigated using confocal microscopy measurements of flowing human blood and cell resolved blood flow simulations. Fluorescent platelet concentrations at the wall of a glass chamber are measured using confocal microscopy with flowing human blood containing varying healthy-to-stiff RBC fractions. A decrease is observed in the fluorescent platelet signal at the wall due to the increase of stiffened RBCs in flow, suggesting a decrease of platelet margination due to an increased fraction of stiffened RBCs present in the flow. In order to resolve the influence of stiffened RBCs on platelet concentration at the channel wall, cell-pair and bulk flow simulations are performed. For homogeneous collisions between RBC pairs, a decrease in final displacement after a collision with increasing membrane stiffness is observed. In heterogeneous collisions between healthy and stiff RBC pairs, it is found that the stiffened RBC is displaced most. The influence of RBC deformability on collisions between RBCs and platelets was found to be negligible due to their size and mass difference. For a straight vessel geometry with varying healthy-to-stiff RBC ratios, a decrease was observed in the red blood cell-free layer and platelet margination due to an increase in stiffened RBCs present in flow. Biophysically detailed mathematical models of multiscale cardiac active mechanics We propose four novel mathematical models, describing the microscopic mechanisms of force generation in the cardiac muscle tissue, which are suitable for multiscale numerical simulations of cardiac electromechanics. Such models are based on a biophysically accurate representation of the regulatory and contractile proteins in the sarcomeres. Our models, unlike most of the sarcomere dynamics models that are available in the literature and that feature a comparable richness of detail, do not require the time-consuming Monte Carlo method for their numerical approximation. Conversely, the models that we propose only require the solution of a system of PDEs and/or ODEs (the most reduced of the four only involving 20 ODEs), thus entailing a significant computational efficiency. By focusing on the two models that feature the best trade-off between detail of description and identifiability of parameters, we propose a pipeline to calibrate such parameters starting from experimental measurements available in literature. Thanks to this pipeline, we calibrate these models for room-temperature rat and for body-temperature human cells. We show, by means of numerical simulations, that the proposed models correctly predict the main features of force generation, including the steady-state force-calcium and force-length relationships, the length-dependent prolongation of twitches and increase of peak force, the force-velocity relationship. Moreover, they correctly reproduce the Frank-Starling effect, when employed in multiscale 3D numerical simulation of cardiac electromechanics. Ranking and characterization of established BMI and lipid associated loci as candidates for gene-environment interactions Author summary Most contemporary studies of gene-environment interactions focus on gene variants that are known to bear strong and reliable associations with the traits of interest. The strategy is intuitive because it helps limit the number of tests performed by focusing on a relatively small number of gene variants. However, this approach is predicated on an implicit assumption that these loci are strong candidates for interactions owing to their established relationships with the index traits. The counter-argument is that, because these loci have highly consistent signals within and between populations that vary by environmental characteristics, the probability that these variants interact with other factors is low. The current analysis tests whether variants with strong marginal effects signals (i.e., those prioritized through conventional genome-wide association analyses) are strong or weak candidates for gene-environment interactions. Here we describe analyses focused on lipids and BMI that test this hypothesis by comparing marginal effect signals with variance effect signals and those derived from explicit genome-wide, gene-environment interaction analyses. We conclude that for BMI, there are features of the top-ranking marginal effect loci that render them stronger candidates for interactions than is true of variants with weaker marginal effects signals. These findings are likely to help optimize the efficiency of future gene-environment interaction analyses by providing evidence-based rankings for strong candidate loci. Neotropical bats that co-habit with humans function as dead-end hosts for dengue virus Several studies have shown Dengue Virus (DENV) nucleic acids and/or antibodies present in Neotropical wildlife including bats, suggesting that some bat species may be susceptible to DENV infection. Here we aim to elucidate the role of house-roosting bats in the DENV transmission cycle. Bats were sampled in households located in high and low dengue incidence regions during rainy and dry seasons in Costa Rica. We captured 318 bats from 12 different species in 29 households. Necropsies were performed in 205 bats to analyze virus presence in heart, lung, spleen, liver, intestine, kidney, and brain tissue. Histopathology studies from all organs showed no significant findings of disease or infection. Sera were analyzed by PRNT90 for a seroprevalence of 21.2% (51/241), and by PCR for 8.8% (28/318) positive bats for DENV RNA. From these 28 bats, 11 intestine samples were analyzed by RT-PCR. Two intestines were DENV RNA positive for the same dengue serotype detected in blood. Viral isolation from all positive organs or blood was unsuccessful. Additionally, viral load analyses in positive blood samples by qRT-PCR showed virus concentrations under the minimal dose required for mosquito infection. Simultaneously, 651 mosquitoes were collected using EVS-CO2 traps and analyzed for DENV and feeding preferences (bat cytochrome b). Only three mosquitoes were found DENV positive and none was positive for bat cytochrome b. Our results suggest an accidental presence of DENV in bats probably caused from oral ingestion of infected mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest also a spillover event from humans to bats. Therefore, we conclude that bats in these urban environments do not sustain DENV amplification, they do not have a role as reservoirs, but function as epidemiological dead end hosts for this virus. Zika virus outbreak in the Pacific: Vector competence of regional vectors Background In 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several potential Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to the ZIKV transmission including Aedes aegypti, the main arbovirus vector in the region, and Aedes polynesiensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector of dengue virus. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of these two Pacific vectors to transmit ZIKV at a regional scale, through the evaluation and comparison of the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain which circulated in this region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. Methodology/principal findings Field Ae. aegypti (three populations) and Ae. polynesiensis (two populations) from the Pacific region were collected for this study. Female mosquitoes were orally exposed to ZIKV (107 TCID50/mL) isolated in the region in 2014. At 6, 9, 14 and 21 days post-infection, mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), heads and saliva were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency, respectively. According to our results, ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae. aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogenous between these populations. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. Conclusion/significance Our results indicated a low ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region. These results were unexpected and suggest the importance of other factors especially the vector density, the mosquito lifespan or the large immunologically naive fraction of the population that may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. Potential of Aedes albopictus to cause the emergence of arboviruses in Morocco In 2015, the mosquito Aedes albopictus was detected in Rabat, Morocco. This invasive species can be involved in the transmission of more than 25 arboviruses. It is known that each combination of mosquito population and virus genotype leads to a specific interaction that can shape the outcome of infection. Testing the vector competence of local mosquitoes is therefore a prerequisite to assess the risks of emergence. A field-collected strain of Ae. albopictus from Morocco was experimentally infected with dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), zika (ZIKV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses. We found that this species can highly transmit CHIKV and to a lesser extent, DENV, ZIKV and YFV. Viruses can be detected in mosquito saliva at day 3 (CHIKV), day 14 (DENV and YFV), and day 21 (ZIKV) post-infection. These results suggest that the local transmission of these four arboviruses by Ae. albopictus newly introduced in Morocco is a likely scenario. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov APAFIS#6573-201606l412077987v2. Management of insecticide resistance in the major Aedes vectors of arboviruses: Advances and challenges Background The landscape of mosquito-borne disease risk has changed dramatically in recent decades, due to the emergence and reemergence of urban transmission cycles driven by invasive Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Insecticide resistance is already widespread in the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. Aegypti; is emerging in the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. Albopictus; and is now threatening the global fight against human arboviral diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Because the panel of insecticides available for public health is limited, it is of primary importance to preserve the efficacy of existing and upcoming active ingredients. Timely implementation of insecticide resistance management (IRM) is crucial to maintain the arsenal of effective public health insecticides and sustain arbovirus vector control. Methodology and principal findings This Review is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN) and aims at defining the principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting the evolution of resistance, and evaluating the value of existing tools for resistance monitoring. Based on the lessons taken from resistance strategies used for other vector species and agricultural pests, we propose a framework for the implementation of IRM strategies for Aedes mosquito vectors. Conclusions and significance Although IRM should be a fixture of all vector control programs, it is currently often absent from the strategic plans to control mosquito-borne diseases, especially arboviruses. Experiences from other public health disease vectors and agricultural pests underscore the need for urgent action in implementing IRM for invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Based on a plan developed for malaria vectors, here we propose some key activities to establish a global plan for IRM in Aedes spp. A Regional Reduction in Ito and IKACh in the Murine Posterior Left Atrial Myocardium Is Associated with Action Potential Prolongation and Increased Ectopic Activity BackgroundThe left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) is potentially an important area for the development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. We assessed whether there are regional electrical differences throughout the murine left atrial myocardium that could underlie regional differences in arrhythmia susceptibility.MethodsWe used high-resolution optical mapping and sharp microelectrode recordings to quantify regional differences in electrical activation and repolarisation within the intact, superfused murine left atrium and quantified regional ion channel mRNA expression by Taqman Low Density Array. We also performed selected cellular electrophysiology experiments to validate regional differences in ion channel function.ResultsSpontaneous ectopic activity was observed during sustained 1Hz pacing in 10/19 intact LA and this was abolished following resection of LAPW (0/19 resected LA, P<0.001). The source of the ectopic activity was the LAPW myocardium, distinct from the pulmonary vein sleeve and LAA, determined by optical mapping. Overall, LAPW action potentials (APs) were ca. 40% longer than the LAA and this region displayed more APD heterogeneity. mRNA expression of Kcna4, Kcnj3 and Kcnj5 was lower in the LAPW myocardium than in the LAA. Cardiomyocytes isolated from the LAPW had decreased Ito and a reduced IKACh current density at both positive and negative test potentials.ConclusionsThe murine LAPW myocardium has a different electrical phenotype and ion channel mRNA expression profile compared with other regions of the LA, and this is associated with increased ectopic activity. If similar regional electrical differences are present in the human LA, then the LAPW may be a potential future target for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Diastolic Left Ventricular Function in Relation to Urinary and Serum Collagen Biomarkers in a General Population Current knowledge on the pathogenesis of diastolic heart failure predominantly rests on case-control studies involving symptomatic patients with preserved ejection fraction and relying on invasive diagnostic procedures including endomyocardial biopsy. Our objective was to gain insight in serum and urinary biomarkers reflecting collagen turnover and associated with asymptomatic diastolic LV dysfunction. We randomly recruited 782 Flemish (51.3% women; 50.5 years). We assessed diastolic LV function from the early and late diastolic peak velocities of the transmitral blood flow and of the mitral annulus. By sequencing urinary peptides, we identified 70 urinary collagen fragments. In serum, we measured carboxyterminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (PICP) as marker of collagen I synthesis and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1), an inhibitor of collagen-degrading enzymes. In multivariable-adjusted analyses with Bonferroni correction, we expressed effect sizes per 1-SD in urinary collagen I (uCI) or collagen III (uCIII) fragments. In relation to uCI fragments, e\\' decreased by 0.183 cm/s (95% confidence interval, 0.017 to 0.350; p = 0.025), whereas E/e\\' increased by 0.210 (0.067 to 0.353; p = 0.0012). E/e\\' decreased with uCIII by 0.168 (0.021 to 0.316; p = 0.018). Based on age-specific echocardiographic criteria, 182 participants (23.3%) had subclinical diastolic LV dysfunction. Partial least squares discriminant analysis contrasting normal vs. diastolic LV dysfunction confirmed the aforementioned associations with the uCI and uCIII fragments. PICP and TIMP-1 increased in relation to uCI (p<0.0001), whereas these serum markers decreased with uCIII (p≤0.0006). Diastolic LV dysfunction was associated with higher levels of TIMP-1 (653 vs. 696 ng/mL; p = 0.013). In a general population, the non-invasively assessed diastolic LV function correlated inversely with uCI and serum markers of collagen I deposition, but positively with uCIII. These observations generalise previous studies in patients to randomly recruited people, in whom diastolic LV function ranged from normal to subclinical impairment, but did not encompass overt diastolic heart failure. ispartof: PLoS One vol:11 issue:12 ispartof: location:United States status: published Drawbacks of Dialysis Procedures for Removal of EDTA Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a chelating agent commonly used in protein purification, both to eliminate contaminating divalent cations and to inhibit protease activity. For a number of subsequent applications EDTA needs to be exhaustively removed. Most purification methods rely in extensive dialysis and/or gel filtration in order to exchange or remove protein buffer components, including metal chelators. We report here that dialysis protocols,even as extensive as those typically employed for protein refolding, may not effectively remove EDTA, which is reduced only by approximately two-fold and it also persists after spin-column gel filtration, as determined by NMR and by colorimetric methods. Remarkably, the most efficient removal was achieved by ultrafiltration, after which EDTA became virtually undetectable. These results highlight a potentially widespread source of experimental variability affecting free divalent cation concentrations in protein applications. Reduced cerebrospinal fluid concentration of interleukin-12/23 subunit p40 in patients with cognitive impairment Background The role of inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other cognitive disorders is unclear. In a well-defined mono-center population, we measured cytokines and chemokines in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Methods Consecutive patients with AD (n = 30), stable mild cognitive impairment (SMCI, n = 11), other dementias (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 18) were included. None of the subjects was treated with glucocorticoids, cholinesterase inhibitors, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Serum and CSF concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-12/23 p40, IL-15, IL-16, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and three chemokines were measured using a multiplex panel. Results After correction for multiple comparisons, only CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentration differed significantly between the total patient group (n = 52) and controls (n = 18; p = 0.002). Further analyses showed that CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentration was decreased in all patient subgroups (AD, other dementias, and SMCI) compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively). In the total study population (n = 70), CSF IL-12/23 p40 concentrations correlated positively with CSF concentrations of β-amyloid1-42 (Aβ1–42) and phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau) whereas in AD patients (n = 30), CSF IL-12/23 p40 only correlated positively with CSF P-Tau (r = 0.46, p = 0.01). Conclusions Most cytokines and chemokines were similar in patients and controls, but CSF IL-12/23 subunit p40 concentration was decreased in patients with cognitive impairment, and correlated with markers of AD disease status. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of CSF IL-12/23 p40 in other dementias and SMCI. Urinary Proteomics in Predicting Heart Transplantation Outcomes (uPROPHET)—Rationale and database description Objectives Urinary Proteomics in Predicting Heart Transplantation Outcomes (uPROPHET; NCT03152422) aims: (i) to construct new multidimensional urinary proteomic (UP) classifiers that after heart transplantation (HTx) help in detecting graft vasculopathy, monitoring immune system activity and graft performance, and in adjusting immunosuppression; (ii) to sequence UP peptide fragments and to identify key proteins mediating HTx-related complications; (iii) to validate UP classifiers by demonstrating analogy between UP profiles and tissue proteomic signatures (TP) in diseased explanted hearts, to be compared with normal donor hearts; (iv) and to identify new drug targets. This article describes the uPROPHET database construction, follow-up strategies and baseline characteristics of the HTx patients. Methods HTx patients enrolled at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg (Leuven) collected mid-morning urine samples. Cardiac biopsies were obtained at HTx. UP and TP methods and the statistical work flow in pursuit of the research objectives are described in detail in the Data supplement. Results Of 352 participants in the UP study (24.4% women), 38.9%, 40.3%, 5.7% and 15.1% had ischemic, dilated, hypertrophic or other cardiomyopathy. The median interval between HTx and first UP assessment (baseline) was 7.8 years. At baseline, mean values were 56.5 years for age, 25.2 kg/m2 for body mass index, 142.3/84.8 mm Hg and 124.2/79.8 mm Hg for office and 24-h ambulatory systolic/diastolic pressure, and 58.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 for the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Of all patients, 37.2% and 6.5% had a history of mild (grade = 1B) or severe (grade ≥ 2) cellular rejection. Anti-body mediated rejection had occurred in 6.2% patients. The number of follow-up urine samples available for future analyses totals over 950. The TP study currently includes biopsies from 7 healthy donors and 15, 14, and 3 patients with ischemic, dilated, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Conclusions uPROPHET constitutes a solid resources for UP and TP research in the field of HTx and has the ambition to lay the foundation for the clinical application of UP in risk stratification in HTx patients. Evolution of nodule stiffness might predict response to local ablative therapy: A series of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Background Early information on treatment response of HCC to local ablative therapy is crucial. Elastography as a non-invasive method has recently been shown to play a potential role in distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions. Elastography of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in early response to local ablative therapy has not been studied to date. Methods We prospectively included a cohort of 14 patients with diagnosis of HCC who were treated with local ablative therapy (transarterial chemoembolization, TACE and/or radiofrequency ablation, RFA). We used 2D shear-wave elastography (RT 2D-SWE) to examine stiffness of HCC lesion before and 3, 30 and 90 days after local ablative therapy. Contrast-enhanced imaging after 90 days was performed to evaluate treatment response. Primary endpoint was stiffness of HCC in response to local ablative therapy. Secondary end point was tumor recurrence. Results Stiffness of HCC nodules and liver showed no significant difference prior to local ablative therapy. As early as three days after treatment, stiffness of responding HCC was significantly higher compared to non-responding. Higher stiffness before treatment was significantly associated with tumor recurrence. Conclusion Nodule stiffness in general and RT 2D-SWE in particular could provide a useful tool for early prediction of HCC response to local ablative therapy. Optimized 3D co-registration of ultra-low-field and high-field magnetic resonance images The prototypes of ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI scanners developed in recent years represent new, innovative, cost-effective and safer systems, which are suitable to be integrated in multi-modal (Magnetoencephalography and MRI) devices. Integrated ULF-MRI and MEG scanners could represent an ideal solution to obtain functional (MEG) and anatomical (ULF MRI) information in the same environment, without errors that may limit source reconstruction accuracy. However, the low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ULF images, as well as their limited coverage, do not generally allow for the construction of an accurate individual volume conductor model suitable for MEG localization. Thus, for practical usage, a high-field (HF) MRI image is also acquired, and the HF-MRI images are co-registered to the ULF-MRI ones. We address here this issue through an optimized pipeline (SWIM—Sliding WIndow grouping supporting Mutual information). The co-registration is performed by an affine transformation, the parameters of which are estimated using Normalized Mutual Information as the cost function, and Adaptive Simulated Annealing as the minimization algorithm. The sub-voxel resolution of the ULF images is handled by a sliding-window approach applying multiple grouping strategies to down-sample HF MRI to the ULF-MRI resolution. The pipeline has been tested on phantom and real data from different ULF-MRI devices, and comparison with well-known toolboxes for fMRI analysis has been performed. Our pipeline always outperformed the fMRI toolboxes (FSL and SPM). The HF–ULF MRI co-registration obtained by means of our pipeline could lead to an effective integration of ULF MRI with MEG, with the aim of improving localization accuracy, but also to help exploit ULF MRI in tumor imaging. Peer reviewed Epidemiological and histological findings implicate matrix Gla protein in diastolic left ventricular dysfunction OBJECTIVES: A novel paradigm of diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction proposes involvement of the cardiac microvasculature. Vitamin K dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) plays a role in preserving microcirculatory integrity. We hypothesized that LV filling pressure-a measure of diastolic LV dysfunction-increases with higher plasma level of inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). We also studied the distribution of active and inactive MGP in human myocardium. METHODS: We measured echocardiographic diastolic LV function and plasma dp-ucMGP (ELISA) in 668 Flemish and for replication in 386 Swiss. RESULTS: Among Flemish and Swiss, E/e\\' (6.78 vs. 6.73) and dp-ucMGP (3.94 μg/L vs. 4.20 μg/L) were similarly distributed. In multivariable-adjusted models, for each doubling of dp-ucMGP, E/e\\' increased by 0.26, 0.33 and 0.31 in Flemish, Swiss and both cohorts combined (P≤0.026); the odds ratios for having E/e\\' ≥ 8.5 were 1.99, 3.29 and 2.36, respectively (P≤0.017). Cardiac biopsies from patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and healthy hearts (n = 4 for each) were stained with conformation-specific MGP antibodies. In diseased compared with normal hearts, uncarboxylated inactive MGP was more prevalent (P≤0.004) in the perivascular matrix and interstitium (204.4 vs. 8.6 μm2 per field) and phosphorylated active MGP in and around capillaries and interstitial cells (31.3 vs. 6.6 number of positive capillaries and cells per field). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a role of activated MGP in maintaining myocardial integrity and diastolic LV performance and can potentially be translated into new strategies for managing diastolic LV dysfunction and preventing its progression to heart failure. ispartof: PLoS One vol:13 issue:3 ispartof: location:United States status: published Blood-based cerebral biomarkers in preeclampsia: Plasma concentrations of NfL, tau, S100B and NSE during pregnancy in women who later develop preeclampsia - A nested case control study Objective To evaluate if concentrations of the neuronal proteins neurofilament light chain and tau are changed in women developing preeclampsia and to evaluate the ability of a combination of neurofilament light chain, tau, S100B and neuron specific enolase in identifying neurologic impairment before diagnosis of preeclampsia. Methods A nested case-control study within a longitudinal study cohort was performed. 469 healthy pregnant women were enrolled between 2004–2007 and plasma samples were collected at gestational weeks 10, 25, 28, 33 and 37. Plasma concentrations of tau and neurofilament light chain were analyzed in 16 women who eventually developed preeclampsia and 36 controls throughout pregnancy with single molecule array (Simoa) method and compared within and between groups. S100B and NSE had been analyzed previously in the same study population. A statistical model with receiving characteristic operation curve was constructed with the four biomarkers combined. Results Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain were significantly increased in women who developed preeclampsia in gestational week 33 (11.85 ng/L, IQR 7.48–39.93 vs 6.80 ng/L, IQR 5.65–11.40) and 37 (22.15 ng/L, IQR 10.93–35.30 vs 8.40 ng/L, IQR 6.40–14.30) and for tau in gestational week 37 (4.33 ng/L, IQR 3.97–12.83 vs 3.77 ng/L, IQR 1.91–5.25) in contrast to healthy controls. A combined model for preeclampsia with tau, neurofilament light chain, S100B and neuron specific enolase in gestational week 25 displayed an area under the curve of 0.77, in week 28 it was 0.75, in week 33 it was 0.89 and in week 37 it was 0.83. Median week for diagnosis of preeclampsia was at 38 weeks of gestation. Conclusion Concentrations of both tau and neurofilament light chain are increased in the end of pregnancy in women developing preeclampsia in contrast to healthy pregnancies. Cerebral biomarkers might reflect cerebral involvement before onset of disease. Differentiation and quantification of fibrosis, fat and fatty fibrosis in human left atrial myocardium using ex vivo MRI Background: Atrial fibrillation is associated with an atrial cardiomyopathy composed mainly of fibrosis and adipose tissue accumulation. We hypothesized that MRI, when used in an optimal ex vivo setting allowing high spatial resolution without motion artifacts, can help characterizing the complex 3D left atrial (LA) wall composition in human myocardial samples, as compared to histology. Methods: This prospective case-control study was approved by the institutional review board. 3D MRI acquisitions including saturation-recovery T1 mapping and DIXON imaging was performed at 4.0 T on 9 human LA samples collected from patients who underwent cardiac surgery. Histological quantification of fibrosis and fat was obtained. MRI T1 maps were clustered based on a Gaussian Mixture Model allowing quantification of total, interstitial and fatty fibrosis components. Fat maps were computed from DIXON images and fat fractions were calculated. MRI measurements were performed on the same location as the histological analysis (plane) and on the entire sample volume (3D). Results: High correlations and levels of agreement were observed between MRI and histology for total (r = 0.93), interstitial (r = 0.93) and fatty fibrosis (r = 0.98) and fat (r = 0.96). Native T1 correlated with the amount of fibrosis from MRI and histology. The 3D MRI total, interstitial and fatty fibrosis ranges were between 6% and 23%, 4% and 17.3%; and 1.4% and 19.7% respectively. Conclusion: High Field ex vivo MRI was able to quantify different LA myocardial components with high agreement in 2D with histology and moreover to provide 3D quantification of such components whereas in vivo application remains a challenge. A low-cost fluorescence reader for in vitro transcription and nucleic acid detection with Cas13a AbstractPoint-of-care testing (POCT) in low-resource settings requires tools that can operate independent of typical laboratory infrastructure. Due to its favorable signal-to-background ratio, a wide variety of biomedical tests utilize fluorescence as a readout. However, fluorescence techniques often require expensive or complex instrumentation and can be difficult to adapt for POCT. To address this issue, we developed a pocket-sized fluorescence detector costing less than _$15 that is easy to manufacture and can operate in low-resource settings. It is built from standard electronic components, including an LED and a light dependent resistor, filter foils and 3D printed parts, and reliably detected less than 10 nM fluorescein concentrations (with a lower limit of detection of ≈6.8 nM), which is sufficient to follow typical biochemical reactions used in POCT applications. All assays are conducted on filter paper, which allows for a flat detector architecture to improve signal collection. We validate the device by quantifying in vitro RNA transcription and also demonstrate sequence-specific detection of target RNAs in the nanomolar range using a Cas13a-based fluorescence assay. Cas13a is a RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR effector with promiscuous RNase activity upon recognition of its RNA target. Cas13a sensing is highly specific and adaptable and in combination with our detector represents a promising approach for nucleic acid POCT. Furthermore, our open-source device architecture could be a valuable educational tool that integrates hardware, software and biochemistry concepts. A modeling and machine learning approach to ECG feature engineering for the detection of ischemia using pseudo-ECG Early detection of coronary heart disease (CHD) has the potential to prevent the millions of deaths that this disease causes worldwide every year. However, there exist few automatic methods to detect CHD at an early stage. A challenge in the development of these methods is the absence of relevant datasets for their training and validation. Here, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 model and the O\\'Hara-Rudy model for human myocytes were used to create two populations of models that were in concordance with data obtained from healthy individuals (control populations) and included inter-subject variability. The effects of ischemia were subsequently included in the control populations to simulate the effects of mild and severe ischemic events on single cells, full ischemic cables of cells and cables of cells with various sizes of ischemic regions. Action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers were measured to assess how the evolution of ischemia could be quantified. Finally, two neural network classifiers were trained to identify the different degrees of ischemia using the pseudo-ECG biomarkers. The control populations showed action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers within the physiological ranges and the trends in the biomarkers commonly identified in ischemic patients were observed in the ischemic populations. On the one hand, inter-subject variability in the ischemic pseudo-ECGs precluded the detection and classification of early ischemic events using any single biomarker. On the other hand, the neural networks showed sensitivity and positive predictive value above 95%. Additionally, the neural networks revealed that the biomarkers that were relevant for the detection of ischemia were different from those relevant for its classification. This work showed that a computational approach could be used, when data is scarce, to validate proof-of-concept machine learning methods to detect ischemic events. Nasal sprayed particle deposition in a human nasal cavity under different inhalation conditions Deposition of polydisperse particles representing nasal spray application in a human nasal cavity was performed under transient breathing profiles of sniffing, constant flow, and breath hold. The LES turbulence model was used to describe the fluid phase. Particles were introduced into the flow field with initial spray conditions, including spray cone angle, insertion angle, and initial velocity. Since nasal spray atomizer design determines the particle conditions, fifteen particle size distributions were used, each defined by a log-normal distribution with a different volume mean diameter (Dv50). Particle deposition in the anterior region was approximately 80% when Dv50 > 50μm, and this decreased to 45% as Dv50 decreased to 10μ m for constant and sniff breathing conditions. The decrease in anterior deposition was countered with increased deposition in the middle and posterior regions. The significance of increased deposition in the middle region for drug delivery shows there is potential for nasal delivered drugs to reach the highly vascularised mucosal walls in the main nasal passages. For multiple targeted deposition sites, an optimisation equation was introduced where deposition results of any two targeted sites could be combined and a weighting between 0 to 1 was applied to each targeted site, representing the relative importance of each deposition site. Pathophysiological role of prostanoids in coagulation of the portal venous system in liver cirrhosis BACKGROUND: Prostanoids are important regulators of platelet aggregation and thrombotic arterial diseases. Their involvement in the development of portal vein thrombosis, frequent in decompensated liver cirrhosis, is still not investigated. METHODS: Therefore, we used pro-thrombotic venous milieu generation by bare metal stent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion, to study the role of prostanoids in decompensated liver cirrhosis. Here, 89 patients receiving transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion were included in the study, and baseline levels of thromboxane B2, prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 were measured in the portal and the hepatic vein. RESULTS: While the hepatic vein contained higher levels of thromboxane B2 than the portal vein, levels of prostaglandin E2 and D2 were higher in the portal vein (all P<0.0001). Baseline concentrations of thromboxane B2 in the portal vein were independently associated with an increase of portal hepatic venous pressure gradient during short term follow-up, as an indirect sign of thrombogenic potential (multivariable P = 0.004). Moreover, severity of liver disease was inversely correlated with portal as well as hepatic vein levels of prostaglandin D2 and E2 (all P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated portal venous thromboxane B2 concentrations are possibly associated with the extent of thrombogenic potential in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03584204. Neurofilaments in blood is a new promising preclinical biomarker for the screening of natural scrapie in sheep Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats belonging to the group of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy or prion diseases. The EU has adopted mandatory measures for scrapie surveillance to safeguard public and animal health because it is highly contagious and might decimate all genetic susceptible animals in affected flocks. Definite diagnosis of scrapie relies on the detection of the pathological prion protein in brain tissues and there are still no blood biomarkers available for making diagnosis in living animals that can be used for the screening of sheep in scrapie-affected flocks. Neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a valid biomarker for neuronal and axonal damages, can now be easily measured in blood by the ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Recent work reported that serum NfL is increased in neurodegenerative diseases, including human prion diseases, but no data are available for scrapie or other animal prion diseases. Here, we found that the median serum NfL concentration in scrapie animals (56.2, IQR 42.2-84.8, n = 9) was more than 15 times higher (p = 0.00084) than that found in control samples (3.4, IQR 3.0-26.3, n = 11). Moreover, serum NfL concentration in scrapie sheep with clinical signs (n = 2; 75.3, 15.7 pg/ml) did not significantly (p = 0.541; t-test) differ from scrapie animals without clinical signs (n = 7; 61.0, 10.7 pg/ml). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis estimated the cut-off value of 31 pg/ml serum NfL for distinguishing scrapie-infected sheep from controls. The application of this cut-off value gives an accuracy of the test of 95% (percent error of 5.23%). These data indicate that the Simoa test for serum NfL might be a useful screening method for detecting preclinical scrapie in living sheep. Finally, the preliminary data reported here need confirmation in large and more structured studies. The selective autophagy receptors Optineurin and p62 are both required for zebrafish host resistance to mycobacterial infection Mycobacterial pathogens are the causative agents of chronic infectious diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy. Autophagy has recently emerged as an innate mechanism for defense against these intracellular pathogens. In vitro studies have shown that mycobacteria escaping from phagosomes into the cytosol are ubiquitinated and targeted by selective autophagy receptors. However, there is currently no in vivo evidence for the role of selective autophagy receptors in defense against mycobacteria, and the importance of autophagy in control of mycobacterial diseases remains controversial. Here we have used Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), which causes a tuberculosis-like disease in zebrafish, to investigate the function of two selective autophagy receptors, Optineurin (Optn) and SQSTM1 (p62), in host defense against a mycobacterial pathogen. To visualize the autophagy response to Mm in vivo, optn and p62 zebrafish mutant lines were generated in the background of a GFP-Lc3 autophagy reporter line. We found that loss-of-function mutation of optn or p62 reduces autophagic targeting of Mm, and increases susceptibility of the zebrafish host to Mm infection. Transient knockdown studies confirmed the requirement of both selective autophagy receptors for host resistance against Mm infection. For gain-of-function analysis, we overexpressed optn or p62 by mRNA injection and found this to increase the levels of GFP-Lc3 puncta in association with Mm and to reduce the Mm infection burden. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both Optn and p62 are required for autophagic host defense against mycobacterial infection and support that protection against tuberculosis disease may be achieved by therapeutic strategies that enhance selective autophagy. The possible role of cross-reactive dengue virus antibodies in Zika virus pathogenesis Zika virus (ZIKV) has been known for decades to circulate in Africa and Asia. However, major complications of a ZIKV infection have recently become apparent for reasons that are still not fully elucidated. One of the hypotheses for the seemingly increased pathogenicity of ZIKV is that cross-reactive dengue antibodies can enhance a ZIKV infection through the principle of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Recently, ADE in ZIKV infection has been studied, but conclusive evidence for the clinical importance of this principle in a ZIKV infection is lacking. Conversely, the widespread circulation of ZIKV in dengue virus (DENV)-endemic regions raises new questions about the potential contribution of ZIKV antibodies to DENV ADE. In this review, we summarize the results of the evidence to date and elaborate on other possible detrimental effects of cross-reactive flavivirus antibodies, both for ZIKV infection and the risk of ZIKV-related congenital anomalies, DENV infection, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Sarcopenia Is Associated With Development of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis Receiving Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt INTRODUCTION: Muscle mass has been shown to be a prognostic marker in patients with liver cirrhosis. Transversal psoas muscle thickness normalized by height (TPMT/height) obtained by routine computed tomography is a simple surrogate parameter for sarcopenia. TPMT/height, however, is not sex specific, which might play a role in risk stratification. Its association with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has not been established yet. ACLF is associated with systemic inflammatory dysregulation. This study aimed at evaluating the role of sarcopenia in ACLF development of patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) using sex-specific TPMT/height. METHODS: One hundred eighty-six patients from the prospective Non-invasive Evaluation Program for TIPS and Follow Up Network cohort (observational, real-world TIPS cohort with structured follow-up) were analyzed. TPMT/height was measured from routine computed tomography. The sex-specific cutoff was determined to classify patients as sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic for 1-year mortality after TIPS. Clinical outcome was compared. Primary end points were ACLF and 1-year mortality after TIPS. Secondary end points were development of decompensations (hepatic encephalopathy and ascites) after TIPS. RESULTS: The sex-specific cutoff increases the diagnostic accuracy with regard to primary and secondary end points compared with the unisex cutoff. Sex-specific sarcopenia classification is an independent predictor of 1-year mortality and ACLF development in patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS. Patients in the sarcopenia group showed significantly higher rates of mortality, ascites, overt hepatic encephalopathy, and ACLF after TIPS compared with the nonsarcopenia group. The Chronic Liver Failure Consortium Acute Decompensation score as a marker of systemic inflammation was significantly higher in sarcopenic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time that sarcopenia is related to ACLF development and systemic inflammation. The prognostic value of TPMT/height can be improved by using sex-specific cutoffs. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03584204. Head phantoms for electroencephalography and transcranial electric stimulation: a skull material study Abstract Physical head phantoms allow the assessment of source reconstruction procedures in electroencephalography and electrical stimulation profiles during transcranial electric stimulation. Volume conduction in the head is strongly influenced by the skull, which represents the main conductivity barrier. Realistic modeling of its characteristics is thus important for phantom development. In the present study, we proposed plastic clay as a material for modeling the skull in phantoms. We analyzed five clay types varying in granularity and fractions of fire clay, each with firing temperatures from 550°C to 950°C. We investigated the conductivity of standardized clay samples when immersed in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution with time-resolved four-point impedance measurements. To test the reusability of the clay model, these measurements were repeated after cleaning the samples by rinsing in deionized water for 5 h. We found time-dependent impedance changes for approximately 5 min after immersion in the solution. Thereafter, the conductivities stabilized between 0.0716 S/m and 0.0224 S/m depending on clay type and firing temperatures. The reproducibility of the measurement results proved the effectiveness of the rinsing procedure. Clay provides formability, is permeable to ions, can be adjusted in conductivity value and is thus suitable for the skull modeling in phantoms. Validation of a new assay for α-synuclein detection in cerebrospinal fluid Abstract Background: Abnormal α-synuclein aggregation and deposition is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but is also found in Alzheimer disease (AD). Therefore, there is a gaining interest in α-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as potential biomarker for these neurodegenerative diseases. To broaden the available choices of α-synuclein measurement in CSF, we developed and validated a new assay for detecting total α-synuclein. Methods: This novel ELISA uses commercially available antibodies and is based on electrochemiluminescence technology. The assay protocol is straightforward, with short and simple incubation steps, and requires only small amounts of CSF. We validated this assay for precision, parallelism, dilution linearity, specificity, and spike recovery. We further compared it to the newly validated α-synuclein assay from BioLegend by analyzing a set of 50 CSF samples with both assays. Results: The new assay quantifies α-synuclein in CSF with a lower limit of detection of 36.3 pg/mL and shows no cross-reactivity with human β- and γ-synuclein. Results of dilution linearity, parallelism, spike recovery, and precision classify this assay as well suited for α-synuclein detection in human CSF samples. Conclusions: We present a novel assay based on freely available components to quantify total α-synuclein in CSF as an additional method for α-synuclein as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. The assay convinces with its simple and convenient protocol paired with high sensitivity. Personalized laboratory medicine: a patient-centered future approach Abstract In contrast to population-based medical decision making, which emphasizes the use of evidence-based treatment strategies for groups of patients, personalized medicine is based on optimizing treatment at the level of the individual patient. The creation of molecular profiles of individual patients was made possible by the advent of “omics” technologies, based on high throughput instrumental techniques in combination with biostatistics tools and artificial intelligence. The goal of personalized laboratory medicine is to use advanced technologies in the process of preventive, curative or palliative patient management. Personalized medicine does not rely on changes in concentration of a single molecular marker to make a therapeutic decision, but rather on changes of a profile of markers characterizing an individual patient’s status, taking into account not only the expected response to treatment of the disease but also the expected response of the patient. Such medical approach promises a more effective diagnostics with more effective and safer treatment, as well as faster recovery and restoration of health and improved cost effectiveness. The laboratory medicine profession is aware of its key role in personalized medicine, but to empower the laboratories, at least an enhancement in cooperation between disciplines within laboratory medicine will be necessary. Conformational dynamics of the ABC transporter McjD seen by single‐molecule FRET Abstract ABC transporters utilize ATP for export processes to provide cellular resistance against toxins, antibiotics, and harmful metabolites in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Based on static structure snapshots, it is believed that they use an alternating access mechanism, which couples conformational changes to ATP binding (outward‐open conformation) and hydrolysis (inward‐open) for unidirectional transport driven by ATP. Here, we analyzed the conformational states and dynamics of the antibacterial peptide exporter McjD from Escherichia coli using single‐molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). For the first time, we established smFRET for an ABC exporter in a native‐like lipid environment and directly monitor conformational dynamics in both the transmembrane‐ (TMD) and nucleotide‐binding domains (NBD). With this, we unravel the ligand dependences that drive conformational changes in both domains. Furthermore, we observe intrinsic conformational dynamics in the absence of ATP and ligand in the NBDs. ATP binding and hydrolysis on the other hand can be observed via NBD conformational dynamics. We believe that the progress made here in combination with future studies will facilitate full understanding of ABC transport cycles. High density of\\n            REC\\n            8 constrains sister chromatid axes and prevents illegitimate synaptonemal complex formation During meiosis, cohesin complexes mediate sister chromatid cohesion (SCC), synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly and synapsis. Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we imaged sister chromatid axes in mouse meiocytes that have normal or reduced levels of cohesin complexes, assessing the relationship between localization of cohesin complexes, SCC and SC formation. We show that REC8 foci are separated from each other by a distance smaller than 15% of the total chromosome axis length in wild-type meiocytes. Reduced levels of cohesin complexes result in a local separation of sister chromatid axial elements (LSAEs), as well as illegitimate SC formation at these sites. REC8 but not RAD21 or RAD21L cohesin complexes flank sites of LSAEs, whereas RAD21 and RAD21L appear predominantly along the separated sister-chromatid axes. Based on these observations and a quantitative distribution analysis of REC8 along sister chromatid axes, we propose that the high density of randomly distributed REC8 cohesin complexes promotes SCC and prevents illegitimate SC formation. 18\\n            F‐AV‐1451 and CSF T‐tau and P‐tau as biomarkers in Alzheimer\\'s disease Abstract To elucidate the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total‐tau (T‐tau) and phosphorylated tau (P‐tau) with the tau PET ligand 18 F‐AV‐1451 in Alzheimer9s disease (AD), we examined 30 cognitively healthy elderly (15 with preclinical AD), 14 prodromal AD, and 39 AD dementia patients. CSF T‐tau and P‐tau were highly correlated ( R \\xa0=\\xa00.92, P 18 F‐AV‐1451, and mainly in demented AD patients. 18 F‐AV‐1451, but not CSF T‐tau or P‐tau, was strongly associated with atrophy and cognitive impairment. CSF tau was increased in preclinical AD, despite normal 18 F‐AV‐1451 retention. However, not all dementia AD patients exhibited increased CSF tau, even though 18 F‐AV‐1451 retention was always increased at this disease stage. We conclude that CSF T‐tau and P‐tau mainly behave as biomarkers of “disease state”, since they appear to be increased in many cases of AD at all disease stages, already before the emergence of tau aggregates. In contrast, 18 F‐AV‐1451 is a biomarker of “disease stage”, since it is increased in clinical stages of the disease, and is associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Evolutionary Rescue over a Fitness Landscape ABSTRACTEvolutionary rescue describes a situation where adaptive evolution prevents the extinction of a population facing a stressing environment. Models of evolutionary rescue could in principle be used to predict the level of stress beyond which extinction becomes likely for species of conservation concern, or conversely the treatment levels most likely to limit the emergence of resistant pests or pathogens. Stress levels are known to affect both the rate of population decline (demographic effect) and the speed of adaptation (evolutionary effect), but the latter aspect has received less attention. Here, we address this issue using Fisher’s Geometric Model of adaptation. In this model, the fitness effects of mutations depend both on the genotype and the environment in which they arise. In particular, the model introduces a dependence between the level of stress, the proportion of rescue mutants, and their costs before the onset of stress. We obtain analytic results under a strong-selection-weak-mutation regime, which we compare to simulations. We show that the effect of the environment on evolutionary rescue can be summarized into a single composite parameter quantifying the effective stress level, which is amenable to empirical measurement. We describe a narrow characteristic stress window over which the rescue probability drops from very likely to very unlikely as the level of stress increases. This drop is sharper than in previous models, as a result of the decreasing proportion of stress-resistant mutations as stress increases. We discuss how to test these predictions with rescue experiments across gradients of stress. MRG-1/MRG15 Is a Barrier for Germ Cell to Neuron Reprogramming in Caenorhabditis elegans Chromatin regulators play important roles in the safeguarding of cell identities by opposing the induction of ectopic cell fates and, thereby, preventing forced conversion of cell identities by reprogramming approaches. Our knowledge of chromatin regulators acting as reprogramming barriers in living organisms needs improvement as most studies use tissue culture. We used Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo gene discovery model and automated solid-phase RNA interference screening, by which we identified 10 chromatin-regulating factors that protect cells against ectopic fate induction. Specifically, the chromodomain protein MRG-1 safeguards germ cells against conversion into neurons. MRG-1 is the ortholog of mammalian MRG15 (MORF-related gene on chromosome 15) and is required during germline development in C. elegans. However, MRG-1’s function as a barrier for germ cell reprogramming has not been revealed previously. Here, we further provide protein-protein and genome interactions of MRG-1 to characterize its molecular functions. Conserved chromatin regulators may have similar functions in higher organisms, and therefore, understanding cell fate protection in C. elegans may also help to facilitate reprogramming of human cells. The Role of MicroRNAs in Antiarrhythmic Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide and has an enormous impact on our healthcare system as it is a major contributor of morbidity and mortality. Although there are several therapeutic options available, treatment of AF still remains challenging. AF pathophysiology is complex and still incompletely understood. In general, our understanding of AF is based on two mechanistic paradigms as functional hallmarks of AF: ectopic activity and reentry. Both ectopic activity and reentry are the result of remodelling processes. Functional and/or expressional changes in ion channels, connexins or calcium-handling proteins are important factors in electrical remodelling, whereas signalling processes leading to atrial dilatation and atrial fibrosis are key factors of structural remodelling. In recent years, new intriguing key players in AF pathophysiology have been identified: microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNA fragments that can regulate gene expression and have been demonstrated as important modifiers in signalling cascades leading to electrical and structural remodelling. In this article we review the miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying AF with special emphasis on the perspective of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets for AF treatment. Self-organizing materials built with DNA Abstract Culex quinquefasciatus from areas with the highest incidence of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infections in the Northeast Region of Brazil are refractory to the virus Zika virus (ZIKV) is widely distributed in Brazil and the Northeast Region (NE) is the most affected zone, showing the highest incidence of microcephaly associated with ZIKV congenital infections worldwide. We report attempts to infect three populations of Culex quinquefasciatus from severely affected sites in the NE and Southeast Region (SE) of Brazil with three strains of ZIKV isolated from these localities. An Aedes aegypti population from the SE was used as a positive control. All tested Cx. quinquefasciatus populations were refractory to the ZIKV isolates. For these reasons, we believe Cx. quinquefasciatus should not be considered a potential vector of ZIKV in Brazil. Potential effect of Zika virus infection on human male fertility? ABSTRACT Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) sexual transmission and prolonged viral shedding in semen have been previously reported, suggesting a strong viral affinity for genital tissues. A transient impact of ZIKV on male fertility was shown in animal and human studies. Methods: Adult male patients with confirmed ZIKV infection diagnosed in the city of Araraquara, Brazil during the epidemic season of 2016 were invited one year after the acute infection to respond to a questionnaire of genital symptoms and to provide a semen sample for molecular ZIKV testing and spermogram analysis, as well as a serum sample for hormonal testing. Results: 101 of 187 tested patients had positive ZIKV RT-PCR in plasma and/or urine samples (54%, 72 women and 29 men). Of 15 adult male participants for whom telephone contact was successful, 14 responded to the questionnaire of genital symptoms and six consented to provide a semen sample at a median of 12 months after the acute infection. We report abnormal spermogram results from patients one year after confirmed ZIKV infection. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a possible long-term detrimental effect of ZIKV infection on human male fertility that has to be further explored in well-characterized samples from cohort studies conducted in ZIKV-endemic areas. Zika virus infection among symptomatic patients from two healthcare centers in Sao Paulo State, Brazil: prevalence, clinical characteristics, viral detection in body fluids and serodynamics ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) clinical presentation and frequency/duration of shedding need further clarification. Symptomatic ZIKV-infected individuals identified in two hospitals in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were investigated regarding clinical characteristics, shedding in body fluids, and serodynamics. Ninety-four of 235 symptomatic patients (Site A: 58%; Site B: 16%) had Real-Time PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection; fever, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent, and rash was more frequent compared to ZIKV-negative patients. Real-Time PCR in serum had worse performance compared to plasma, while urine had the highest sensitivity. Shedding in genital fluids and saliva was rare. IgM positivity was the highest <14 days after the symptoms onset (86%), decreasing >28 days (24%); IgG positivity increased >14 days (96%) remaining positive in 94% of patients >28 days. ZIKV prevalence varied importantly in two neighboring cities during the same transmission season. Urine Real-Time PCR can improve diagnostic sensitivity; serum testing is less useful. Accurate serological tests are needed to improve diagnosis and surveillance. The genetics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: current insights Afnan A Alsultan, Rachel Waller, Paul R Heath, Janine Kirby Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), Department of Neuroscience, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in loss of the upper and lower motor neurons from motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. While the majority of cases are sporadic, approximately 10% show familial inheritance. ALS is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although autosomal recessive and X-linked inheritance do occur. To date, 24 of the genes at 26 loci have been identified; these include loci linked to ALS and to frontotemporal dementia-ALS, where family pedigrees contain individuals with frontotemporal dementia with/without ALS. The most commonly established genetic causes of familial ALS (FALS) to date are the presence of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene (39.3% FALS) and mutation of SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS, with frequencies of 12%&ndash;23.5%, 5%, and 4.1%, respectively. However, with the increasing use of next-generation sequencing of small family pedigrees, this has led to an increasing number of genes being associated with ALS. This review provides a comprehensive review on the genetics of ALS and an update of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these genes. Commonly implicated pathways have been established, including RNA processing, the protein degradation pathways of autophagy and ubiquitin&ndash;proteasome system, as well as protein trafficking and cytoskeletal function. Elucidating the role genetics plays in both FALS and sporadic ALS is essential for understanding the subsequent cellular dysregulation that leads to motor neuron loss, in order to develop future effective therapeutic strategies.

However, the impact of dysfunctional adipose tissue has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of resistance to the antilipolytic effect of insulin (adipose tissue IR [Adipo-IR]) in a large group of subjects with NGT, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM. Three hundred two subjects with varying glucose tolerance received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and euglycemic insulin clamp. We evaluated Adipo-IR (fasting and mean OGTT plasma free fatty acid [FFA] × insulin concentrations), peripheral IR (1/[Matsuda index] and (M/I)-1 value), and β-cell function (calculated as the ratio of the increment in plasma insulin to glucose [OGTT/IR (ΔI/ΔG ÷ IR)]). Fasting Adipo-IR was increased twofold in obese subjects with NGT and IGT versus lean subjects with NGT (8.0 ± 1.1 and 9.2 ± 0.7 vs. 4.1 ± 0.3, respectively) and threefold in subjects with T2DM (11.9 ± 0.6; P < 0.001). Progressive decline in ΔI/ΔG ÷ IR was associated with a progressive impairment in FFA suppression during OGTT, whereas the rise in mean plasma glucose concentration only became manifest when subjects became overtly diabetic. The progressive decline in β-cell function that begins in individuals with NGT is associated with a progressive increase in FFA and fasting Adipo-IR. A Global Overview of Precision Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes The detailed characterization of human biology and behaviors is now possible at scale owing to innovations in biomarker, bioimaging, and wearable technologies; ‘big data’ from electronic medical records, health insurance databases and other platforms is also becoming increasingly accessible, and computational power and bioinformatics methods are evolving rapidly. Collectively, these advances are creating unprecedented opportunities to better understanding diabetes and many other complex traits. Identifying hidden structures within these complex datasets and linking these structures to outcome data may yield unique insights into the risk factors and natural history of diabetes, which may in turn help optimize the prevention and management of the disease. This emerging area is broadly termed ‘precision medicine’. In this perspective, we overview the evidence and barriers to the development and implementation of precision medicine in type 2 diabetes. We also discuss recently presented paradigms through which complex data might enhance our understanding of diabetes and ultimately our ability to tackle the disease more effectively than ever before. Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars OBJECTIVE Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG] content), predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks. RESULTS Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P < 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression. CONCLUSIONS Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes. First outbreak of Zika virus in the continental United States: a modelling analysis Since 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread throughout Latin and Central America. This emerging infectious disease has been causing considerable public health concern because of severe neurological complications, especially in newborns after congenital infections. In July 2016, the first outbreak in the continental United States was identified in the Wynwood neighbourhood of Miami-Dade County, Florida. In this work, we investigated transmission dynamics using a mathematical model calibrated to observed data on mosquito abundance and symptomatic human infections. We found that, although ZIKV transmission was detected in July 2016, the first importation may have occurred between March and mid-April. The estimated highest value for R0 was 2.73 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65–4.17); the attack rate was 14% (95% CI: 5.6–27.4%), with 15 (95% CI: 6–29) pregnant women involved and a 12% probability of infected blood donations. Vector control avoided 60% of potential infections. According to our results, it is likely that further ZIKV outbreaks identified in other areas of Miami-Dade County were seeded by commuters to Wynwood rather than by additional importation from international travellers. Our study can help prepare future outbreak-related interventions in European areas where competent mosquitoes for ZIKV transmission are already established. Differential Shedding and Antibody Kinetics of Zika and Chikungunya Viruses, Brazil In seroconversion panels obtained from patients from Brazil, diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection was improved by combining multiple antibody isotypes, techniques, and antigens, but sensitivity remained suboptimal. In contrast, chikungunya virus diagnostic testing was unambiguous. Recurrent recent arbovirus infections suggested by serologic data and unspecific symptoms highlight the need for exhaustive virologic testing. Bat Influenza A(HL18NL11) Virus in Fruit Bats, Brazil Screening of 533 bats for influenza A viruses showed subtype HL18NL11 in intestines of 2 great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus). High concentrations suggested fecal shedding. Genomic characterizations revealed conservation of viral genes across different host species, countries, and sampling years, suggesting a conserved cellular receptor and wide-ranging occurrence of bat influenza A viruses. Cross-Protection of Dengue Virus Infection against Congenital Zika Syndrome, Northeastern Brazil The Zika virus outbreak in Latin America resulted in congenital malformations, called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). For unknown reasons, CZS incidence was highest in northeastern Brazil; one potential explanation is that dengue virus (DENV)–mediated immune enhancement may promote CZS development. In contrast, our analyses of historical DENV genomic data refuted the hypothesis that unique genome signatures for northeastern Brazil explain the uneven dispersion of CZS cases. To confirm our findings, we performed serotype-specific DENV neutralization tests in a case–control framework in northeastern Brazil among 29 Zika virus–seropositive mothers of neonates with CZS and 108 Zika virus–seropositive control mothers. Neutralization titers did not differ significantly between groups. In contrast, DENV seroprevalence and median number of neutralized serotypes were significantly lower among the mothers of neonates with CZS. Supported by model analyses, our results suggest that multitypic DENV infection may protect from, rather than enhance, development of CZS. Reduced Cerebrospinal Fluid Concentration of Apolipoprotein A-I in Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease Abstract: Background: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been extensively studied in Alzheimers disease (AD), but little is known of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Objective: Plasma lipids as well as ApoA-I and ApoE in plasma and CSF were determined and related to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, APOE genotype, and CSF AD biomarkers. Methods: Consecutive patients with AD (n\\u200a=\\u200a29), stable mild cognitive impairment (n\\u200a=\\u200a13), other dementias (n\\u200a=\\u200a14), and healthy controls (n\\u200a=\\u200a18) were included at a single center. Results: AD patients had higher plasma triglycerides and lower CSF ApoA-I concentration than controls (both p\\u200a<\\u200a0.05). CSF ApoE concentration was reduced in other dementias (p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). In AD as well as other dementias, the ratios between CSF and plasma concentrations of both ApoA-I and ApoE were lower than those in the controls. ApoA-I and ApoE in plasma and CSF were not influenced by APOE ɛ4 allele distribution. In the total study population (n\\u200a=\\u200a74), CSF ApoA-I correlated positively with MMSE score (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.26, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.05) and negatively with CSF P-tau (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.25, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.05). CSF ApoE correlated positively with CSF concentrations of T-tau and P-tau in the total study population and in AD patients. Conclusion: CSF ApoA-I was reduced in AD patients and associated with measures of cognitive function and AD disease status. The mechanisms underlying the decreased CSF:plasma ratios of ApoA-I and ApoE in AD and other dementias need to be explored in further studies. Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics and Ionic Block Effects in Six Heterogeneous Human 3D Virtual Atria with Distinct Repolarization Dynamics Atrial fibrillation (AF) usually manifests as reentrant circuits propagating through the whole atria creating chaotic activation patterns. Little is yet known about how differences in electrophysiological and ionic properties between patients modulate reentrant patterns in AF. The goal of this study is to quantify how variability in action potential duration (APD) at different stages of repolarization determines AF dynamics and their modulation by ionic block using a set of virtual whole-atria human models. Six human whole-atria models are constructed based on the same anatomical structure and fiber orientation, but with different electrophysiological phenotypes. Membrane kinetics for each whole-atria model are selected with distinct APD characteristics at 20, 50, and 90% repolarization, from an experimentally calibrated population of human atrial action potential models, including AF remodeling and acetylcholine parasympathetic effects. Our simulations show that in all whole-atria models, reentrant circuits tend to organize around the pulmonary veins and the right atrial appendage, thus leading to higher dominant frequency (DF) and more organized activation in the left atrium than in the right atrium. Differences in APD in all phases of repolarization (not only APD90) yielded quantitative differences in fibrillation patterns with long APD associated with slower and more regular dynamics. Long APD50 and APD20 were associated with increased interatrial conduction block and interatrial differences in DF and organization index, creating reentry instability and self-termination in some cases. Specific inhibitions of IK1, INaK, or INa reduce DF and organization of the arrhythmia by enlarging wave meandering, reducing the number of secondary wavelets, and promoting interatrial block in all six virtual patients, especially for the phenotypes with short APD at 20, 50, and/or 90% repolarization. This suggests that therapies aiming at prolonging the early phase of repolarization might constitute effective antiarrhythmic strategies for the pharmacological management of AF. In summary, simulations report significant differences in atrial fibrillatory dynamics resulting from differences in APD at all phases of repolarization. Genome Dynamics of Escherichia coli during Antibiotic Treatment: Transfer, Loss, and Persistence of Genetic Elements In situ of the Infant Gut Elucidating the adaptive strategies and plasticity of bacterial genomes in situ is crucial for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of pathogens threatening human health. While much is known about the evolution of Escherichia coli in controlled laboratory environments, less effort has been made to elucidate the genome dynamics of E. coli in its native settings. Here, we follow the genome dynamics of co-existing E. coli lineages in situ of the infant gut during the first year of life. One E. coli lineage causes a urinary tract infection (UTI) and experiences several alterations of its genomic content during subsequent antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, all isolates of this uropathogenic E. coli strain carried a highly stable plasmid implicated in virulence of diverse pathogenic strains from all over the world. While virulence elements are certainly beneficial during infection scenarios, their role in gut colonization and pathogen persistence is poorly understood. We performed in vivo competitive fitness experiments to assess the role of this highly disseminated virulence plasmid in gut colonization, but found no evidence for a direct benefit of plasmid carriage. Through plasmid stability assays, we demonstrate that this plasmid is maintained in a parasitic manner, by strong first-line inheritance mechanisms, acting on the single-cell level, rather than providing a direct survival advantage in the gut. Investigating the ecology of endemic accessory genetic elements, in their pathogenic hosts and native environment, is of vital importance if we want to understand the evolution and persistence of highly virulent and drug resistant bacterial isolates. Biomarkers of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis International audience; Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an immune-mediated skin pathology caused mainly by Leishmania (L.) major, Leishmania tropica, Leishmania braziliensis, L. mexicana, and L. amazonensis. The burden of CL in terms of morbidity and social stigmas are concentrated on certain developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America. People with asymptomatic CL represent a large proportion of the infected individuals in the endemic areas who exhibit no lesion and can control the infection by as yet not fully understood mechanisms. Currently, there is no approved prophylactic control measure for CL. Discovery of biomarkers of CL infection and immunity can inform the development of more precise diagnostics tools as well as curative or preventive strategies to control CL. Herein, we provide a brief overview of the state-of-the-art for the biomarkers of CL with a special emphasis on the asymptomatic CL biomarkers. Among the identified CL biomarkers so far, direct biomarkers which indicate the actual presence of the infection as well as indirect biomarkers which reflect the host\\'s reaction to the infection, such as alterations in delayed type hypersensitivity, T-cell subpopulations and cytokines, adenosine deaminase, and antibodies against the sand fly saliva proteins are discussed in detail. The future avenues such as the use of systems analysis to identify and characterize novel CL biomarkers are also discussed. Microbiome Research Is Becoming the Key to Better Understanding Health and Nutrition The human microbiome has emerged as the crucial moderator in the interactions between food and our body. It is increasingly recognised that the microbiome can change our mind and health status, or switch on a wide range of diseases including cancer, cardio-metabolic diseases, allergies, and obesity. The causes of diseases are often only partially understood. However, nutrients, metabolites, and microbes are increasingly regarded as key players, even where the complete disease mechanisms remain unclear. The key to progress in the future will be to use and exploit additional, newly emerging disciplines such as metagenomics to complement patient information and to bring our understanding of diseases and the interrelation and effects of nutritional molecules to the next level. The EU has already funded 216 projects under the 7th Framework Programme and Horizon 2020 programmes to promote metagenomics and to advance our knowledge of microbes. This support started with the catalysing MetaHIT project that has produced a catalogue of gut microbes, and has arrived now at the very multi-disciplinary SYSCID action looking at how the microbiome is driving its resilience potential and our health. Together, these projects involve an investment of more than €498 M. However, in Horizon 2020, the new EU Health and Food Work Programmes for 2018–2020 go even further by setting new goals to find applications and to generate more knowledge on the microbiome, nutrition, various hosts of microbes, and their relation to health and disease. The big vision is to modulate health and diseases via the microbiome and nutrition, while at the same time other factors such as omics, molecular signatures, and lifestyle are constant. In this way, microbiome and nutrition research is moving from an isolated and despised offside position to a beacon of hope with a lot of potential and possibilities. A New Panel-Based Next-Generation Sequencing Method for ADME Genes Reveals Novel Associations of Common and Rare Variants With Expression in a Human Liver Cohort We developed a panel-based NGS pipeline for comprehensive analysis of 340 genes involved in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of drugs, other xenobiotics, and endogenous substances. The 340 genes comprised phase I and II enzymes, drug transporters and regulator/modifier genes within their entire coding regions, adjacent intron regions and 5′ and 3′UTR regions, resulting in a total panel size of 1,382 kbp. We applied the ADME NGS panel to sequence genomic DNA from 150 Caucasian liver donors with available comprehensive gene expression data. This revealed an average read-depth of 343 (range 27–811), while 99% of the 340 genes were covered on average at least 100-fold. Direct comparison of variant annotation with 363 available genotypes determined independently by other methods revealed an overall accuracy of >99%. Of 15,727 SNV and small INDEL variants, 12,022 had a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 2%, including 8,937 singletons. In total we found 7,273 novel variants. Functional predictions were computed for coding variants (n = 4,017) by three algorithms (Polyphen 2, Provean, and SIFT), resulting in 1,466 variants (36.5%) concordantly predicted to be damaging, while 1,019 variants (25.4%) were predicted to be tolerable. In agreement with other studies we found that less common variants were enriched for deleterious variants. Cis-eQTL analysis of variants with (MAF ≥ 2%) revealed significant associations for 90 variants in 31 genes after Bonferroni correction, most of which were located in non-coding regions. For less common variants (MAF < 2%), we applied the SKAT-O test and identified significant associations to gene expression for ADH1C and GSTO1. Moreover, our data allow comparison of functional predictions with additional phenotypic data to prioritize variants for further analysis. The Impact of CYP3A4*22 on Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetics and Outcome in Clinical Practice at a Single Kidney Transplant Center Background: Although there is evidence that the CYP3A4*22 variant should be considered in tacrolimus dosing in renal transplantation, its impact beyond tacrolimus dose requirements remains controversial. Methods: In a cohort of 121 kidney transplant recipients, we analyzed the CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*22, and CYP3A5*3 alleles and the ABCB1 variants 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T for their impact on exposure and dose requirement. Relevant clinical outcome measures such as acute rejection within the first year after transplantation, delayed graft function, and renal function at discharge (estimated glomerular filtration rate) were evaluated. Results: Extensive metabolizer (n = 17, CYP3A4*1/*1 carriers with at least one CYP3A5*1 allele) showed significantly higher tacrolimus dose requirement (P = 0.004) compared with both intermediate metabolizer (IM, n = 93, CYP3A5*3/*3 plus CYP3A4*1/*1 or CYP3A4*22 carriers plus one CYP3A5*1 allele), and poor metabolizer (n = 11, CYP3A4*22 allele in combination with CYP3A5*3/*3) after onset of therapy. Significantly higher dose requirement was observed in CYP3A5 expressers (P = 0.046) compared with non-expressers again at onset of therapy. Using the log additive genetic model, the area under the curve for the total observation period up to 16 days was significantly associated with the CYP3A5*3 genotype (P = 3.34 × 10-4) as well as with the IM or extensive metabolizer phenotype (P = 1.54 × 10-4), even after adjustment for multiple testing. Heterozygous carriers for CYP3A4*22 showed significantly higher areas under the curve than the CYP3A4*1/*1 genotype in the second week post-transplantation (adjusted P = 0.016). Regarding clinical outcomes, acute rejection was significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen mismatch (≥3 alleles; OR = 12.14, 95% CI 1.76, 525.21, P = 0.019 after correction for multiple testing). Graft recipients from deceased donors showed higher incidende of delayed graft function (OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.23, 30.46, adjusted P = 0.0008) and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge (P = 0.0001). Tested CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 variants did not show any effects on clinical outcome parameters. ABCB1 variants did neither impact on pharmacokinetics nor on clinical endpoints. Conclusion: At our transplantation center, both CYP3A5*3 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4*22 affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics early after onset of therapy with consequences for steady-state treatment in routine clinical practice. Molecular Signatures of a TLR4 Agonist-Adjuvanted HIV-1 Vaccine Candidate in Humans Systems biology approaches have recently provided new insights into the mechanisms of action of human vaccines and adjuvants. Here, we investigated early transcriptional signatures induced in whole blood of healthy subjects following vaccination with a recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein subunit CN54-gp140 adjuvanted with the TLR-4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant–aqueous formulation (GLA-AF) and correlated signatures to CN54-gp140 specific serum antibody responses. Fourteen healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years were immunized intramuscularly three times at one-month intervals and whole blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 hours, and 1, 3 and 7 days post first immunization. Subtle changes in the transcriptomic profiles were observed following immunization, ranging from over 300 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at day 1 to nearly 100 DEGs at day 7 following immunization. Functional pathway analysis revealed blood transcription modules (BTMs) related to general cell cycle activation, and innate immune cell activation at early time points, as well as BTMs related to T cells, and B cell activation at the later time points post immunization. Diverse CN54-gp140 specific serum antibody responses of the subjects enabled their categorization into high or low responders, at early (< 1 month) and late (up to 6 months) time points post vaccination. BTM analyses revealed repression of modules enriched in NK cells, and the mitochondrial electron chain, in individuals with high or sustained antigen-specific antibody responses. However, low responders showed an enhancement of BTMs associated with enrichment in myeloid cells and monocytes as well as integrin cell surface interactions. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the subjects revealed an enhanced frequency of CD56dim NK cells in the majority of vaccinees 14 days after vaccination as compared with the baseline. These results emphasize the utility of a systems biology approach to enhance our understanding on the mechanisms of action of TLR4 adjuvanted human vaccines. A Mechanistic Model for Predicting Cell Surface Presentation of Competing Peptides by MHC Class I Molecules Major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) molecules play a central role in the immune response to viruses and cancers. They present peptides on the surface of affected cells, for recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Determining which peptides are presented, and in what proportion, has profound implications for developing effective, medical treatments. However, our ability to predict peptide presentation levels is currently limited. Existing prediction algorithms focus primarily on the binding affinity of peptides to MHC-I, and do not predict the relative abundance of individual peptides on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in situ which is a critical parameter for determining the strength and specificity of the ensuing immune response. Here, we develop and experimentally verify a mechanistic model for predicting cell-surface presentation of competing peptides. Our approach explicitly models key steps in the processing of intracellular peptides, incorporating both peptide binding affinity and intracellular peptide abundance. We use the resulting model to predict how the peptide repertoire is modified by interferon-γ, an immune modulator well known to enhance expression of antigen processing and presentation proteins. Compartmentalization of Immune Response and Microbial Translocation in Decompensated Cirrhosis Background: Acquired dysfunctional immunity in cirrhosis predisposes patients to frequent bacterial infections, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), leading to systemic inflammation that is associated with poor outcome. But systemic inflammation can also be found in the absence of a confirmed infection. Detection of bacterial DNA has been investigated as a marker of SBP and as a predictor of prognosis. Data is, however, contradictory. Here we investigated whether levels of IL-6 and IL-8 putatively produced by myeloid cells in ascites are associated with systemic inflammation and whether inflammation depends on the presence of specific bacterial DNA. Methods and Materials: We enrolled 33 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis from whom we collected paired samples of blood and ascites. IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in serum samples of all patients using ELISA. In a subset of 10 representative patients, bacterial DNA was extracted from ascites and whole blood, followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: There were significantly higher levels of IL-6 in ascites fluid compared to blood samples in all patients. Interestingly, IL-6 levels in blood correlated tightly with disease severity and surrogates of systemic inflammation, while IL-6 levels in ascites did not. Moreover, patients with higher blood CRP levels showed greater SBP prevalence compared to patients with lower levels, despite similar positive culture results. Bacterial richness was also significantly higher in ascites compared to the corresponding patient blood. We identified differences in microbial composition and diversity between ascites and blood, but no tight relationship with surrogates of systemic inflammation could be observed. Discussion: In decompensated cirrhosis, markers of systemic inflammation and microbiota composition seem to be dysregulated in ascites and blood. While a relationship between systemic inflammation and microbiota composition seems to exist in blood, this is not the case for ascites in our hands. These data may suggest compartmentalization of the immune response and interaction of the latter with the microbiota especially in the blood compartment. Increased Serological Response Against Human Herpesvirus 6A Is Associated With Risk for Multiple Sclerosis Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A or HHV-6B involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology has remained controversial mainly due to the lack of serological methods that can distinguish the two viruses. A novel multiplex serological assay measuring IgG reactivity against the immediate-early protein 1 from HHV-6A (IE1A) and HHV-6B (IE1B) was used in a MS cohort (8742 persons with MS and 7215 matched controls), and a pre-MS cohort (478 individuals and 476 matched controls) to investigate this further. The IgG response against IE1A was positively associated with MS (OR = 1.55, p = 9×10−22), and increased risk of future MS (OR = 2.22, p = 2×10−5). An interaction was observed between IE1A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody responses for MS risk (attributable proportion = 0.24, p = 6×10−6). In contrast, the IgG response against IE1B was negatively associated with MS (OR = 0.74, p = 6×10−11). The association did not differ between MS subtypes or vary with severity of disease. The genetic control of HHV-6A/B antibody responses were located to the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region and the strongest association for IE1A was the DRB1*13:01-DQA1*01:03-DQB1*06:03 haplotype while the main association for IE1B was DRB1*13:02-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:04. In conclusion a role for HHV-6A in MS etiology is supported by an increased serological response against HHV-6A IE1 protein, an interaction with EBV, and an association to HLA genes. Adaptive Laboratory Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance Using Different Selection Regimes Lead to Similar Phenotypes and Genotypes Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to human health, wherefore it is crucial to study the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance as well as its emergence and dissemination. One way to analyze the acquisition of de novo mutations conferring antibiotic resistance is adaptive laboratory evolution. However, various evolution methods exist that utilize different population sizes, selection strengths, and bottlenecks. While evolution in increasing drug gradients guarantees high-level antibiotic resistance promising to identify the most potent resistance conferring mutations, other selection regimes are simpler to implement and therefore allow higher throughput. The specific regimen of adaptive evolution may have a profound impact on the adapted cell state. Indeed, substantial effects of the selection regime on the resulting geno- and phenotypes have been reported in the literature. In this study we compare the geno- and phenotypes of Escherichia coli after evolution to Amikacin, Piperacillin, and Tetracycline under four different selection regimes. Interestingly, key mutations that confer antibiotic resistance as well as phenotypic changes like collateral sensitivity and cross-resistance emerge independently of the selection regime. Yet, lineages that underwent evolution under mild selection displayed a growth advantage independently of the acquired level of antibiotic resistance compared to lineages adapted under maximal selection in a drug gradient. Our data suggests that even though different selection regimens result in subtle genotypic and phenotypic differences key adaptations appear independently of the selection regime. The Human Upper Respiratory Tract Epithelium Is Susceptible to Flaviviruses Flaviviruses replicate in a wide variety of species and have a broad cellular tropism. They are isolated from various body fluids, and Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV) RNAs have been detected in nasopharyngeal swabs. Consequently, we evaluated the cellular tropism and host responses upon ZIKV, JEV, WNV, and Usutu virus (USUV) infection using a relevant model of the human upper respiratory tract epithelium based on primary human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) cultured at the air-liquid interface. NECs were susceptible to all the viruses tested, and confocal analysis showed evidence of infection of ciliated and non-ciliated cells. Each flavivirus productively infected NECs, leading to apical and basolateral live virus shedding with particularly high basal release for JEV and WNV. As demonstrated by a paracellular permeability assay, the integrity of the epithelium was not affected by flavivirus infection, suggesting an active release of live virus through the basolateral surface. Also, we detected a significant secretion of interferon type III and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IP-10/CXCL10 upon infection with JEV. Taken together, our data suggest that the human upper respiratory tract epithelium is a target for flaviviruses and could potentially play a role in the spread of infection to other body compartments through basolateral virus release. Undoubtedly, further work is required to evaluate the risks and define the adapted measures to protect individuals exposed to flavivirus-contaminated body fluids. Zika Virus Infection Induces Elevation of Tissue Factor Production and Apoptosis on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is typically characterized by a mild disease presenting with fever, maculopapular rash, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. A recent animal study found that ZIKV-infected pregnant Ifnar-/-mice developed vascular damage in the placenta and reduced amount of fetal capillaries. Moreover, ZIKV infection causes segmental thrombosis in the umbilical cord of pregnant rhesus macaques. Furthermore, several case reports suggest that ZIKV infection cause coagulation disorders. These results suggest that ZIKV could cause an alteration in the host hemostatic response, however, the mechanism has not been investigated thus far. This paper aims to determine whether ZIKV infection on HUVECs induces apoptosis and elevation of tissue factor (TF) that leads to activation of secondary hemostasis. We infected HUVECs with two ZIKV strains and performed virus titration, immunostaining, and flow cytometry to confirm and quantify infection. We measured TF concentrations with flow cytometry and performed thrombin generation test (TGT) as a functional assay to assess secondary hemostasis. Furthermore, we determined the amount of cell death using flow cytometry. We also performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production and conducted blocking experiments to associate these cytokines with TF expression. Both ZIKV strains infected and replicated to high titers in HUVECs. We found that infection induced elevation of TF expressions. We also showed that increased TF expression led to shortened TGT time. Moreover, the data revealed that infection induced apoptosis. In addition, there was a significant increase of IL-6 and IL-8 production in infected cells. Here we provide in vitro evidence that infection of HUVECs with ZIKV induces apoptosis and elevation of TF expression that leads to activation of secondary hemostasis. IGF-1, Inflammation and Retinal Degeneration: A Close Network Retinal degenerative diseases are a group of heterogeneous diseases that include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The progressive degeneration of the retinal neurons results in a severe deterioration of the visual function. Neuroinflammation is an early hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders of the retina including AMD, RP and DR. Microglial cells, key components of the retinal immune defense system, are activated in retinal degenerative diseases. In the microglia the interplay between the proinflammatory/classically activated or antiinflammatory/alternatively activated phenotypes is a complex dynamic process that occurs during the course of disease due to the different environmental signals related to pathophysiological conditions. In this regard, an adequate transition from the proinflammatory to the anti-inflammatory response is necessary to counteract retinal neurodegeneration and its subsequent damage that leads to the loss of visual function. Insulin like-growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been considered as a pleiotropic factor in the retina under health or disease conditions and several effects of IGF-1 in retinal immune modulation have been described. In this review, we provide recent insights of inflammation as a common feature of retinal diseases (AMD, RP and RD) highlighting the role of microglia, exosomes and IGF-1 in this process. Neuromodulation via the Cerebrospinal Fluid: Insights from Recent in Vitro Studies The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occupies the brain’s ventricles and subarachnoid space and, together with the interstitial fluid (ISF), forms a continuous fluidic network that bathes all cells of the central nervous system (CNS). As such, the CSF is well positioned to actively distribute neuromodulators to neural circuits in vivo via volume transmission. Recent in vitro experimental work in brain slices and neuronal cultures has shown that human CSF indeed contains neuromodulators that strongly influence neuronal activity. Here we briefly summarize these new findings and discuss their potential relevance to neural circuits in health and disease. A Systematic Assessment of Prevalence, Incidence and Regional Distribution of Multiple Sclerosis in Bavaria From 2006 to 2015 Introduction: Worldwide, incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased over the last decades. We present a systematic epidemiological study with recent prevalence and incidence rates of MS in Bavaria. Methods: Incidence and prevalence of MS stratified by gender, age groups and region were analyzed by data records from 2006 to 2015 of more than 10 million people insured by the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. Official statistics of the German Federal Ministry of Health provided the size of the general population. Future prevalence was estimated with a predictive model. Results: From 2006 to 2015 prevalence of MS in Bavaria increased from 171 per 100,000 to 277 per 100,000, while incidence rates remained relatively stable (range 16–18 per 100,000 inhabitants with a female to male ratio between 2.4:1 and 2:1). Incidence and prevalence were higher in urban than urbanized and rural areas. The prevalence is expected to increase to 374 per 100,000 in 2040 with the highest prevalence rates between 50 and 65 years. Conclusion: The prevalence of MS in Bavaria is among the highest worldwide and will further rise over the next two decades. This demonstrates a need to strengthen healthcare provision systems due to the increasing numbers of particularly older patients with MS in the future. Non-linear Analysis of Scalp EEG by Using Bispectra: The Effect of the Reference Choice Bispectral analysis is a signal processing technique that makes it possible to capture the non-linear and non-Gaussian properties of the EEG signals. It has found various applications in EEG research and clinical practice, including the assessment of anesthetic depth, the identification of epileptic seizures, and more recently, the evaluation of non-linear cross-frequency brain functional connectivity. However, the validity and reliability of the indices drawn from bispectral analysis of EEG signals are potentially biased by the use of a non-neutral EEG reference. The present study aims at investigating the effects of the reference choice on the analysis of the non-linear features of EEG signals through bicoherence, as well as on the estimation of cross-frequency EEG connectivity through two different non-linear measures, i.e., the cross-bicoherence and the antisymmetric cross-bicoherence. To this end, four commonly used reference schemes were considered: the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally linked mastoids, the average reference, and the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST). The reference effects were assessed both in simulations and in a real EEG experiment. The simulations allowed to investigated: (i) the effects of the electrode density on the performance of the above references in the estimation of bispectral measures; and (ii) the effects of the head model accuracy in the performance of the REST. For real data, the EEG signals recorded from 10 subjects during eyes open resting state were examined, and the distortions induced by the reference choice in the patterns of alpha-beta bicoherence, cross-bicoherence, and antisymmetric cross-bicoherence were assessed. The results showed significant differences in the findings depending on the chosen reference, with the REST providing superior performance than all the other references in approximating the ideal neutral reference. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering the effects of the reference choice in the interpretation and comparison of the results of bispectral analysis of scalp EEG. Optogenetic Light Sensors in Human Retinal Organoids International audience; Optogenetic technologies paved the way to dissect complex neural circuits and monitor neural activity using light in animals. In retinal disease, optogenetics has been used as a therapeutic modality to reanimate the retina after the loss of photoreceptor outer segments. However, it is not clear today which ones of the great diversity of microbial opsins are best suited for therapeutic applications in human retinas as cell lines, primary cell cultures and animal models do not predict expression patterns of microbial opsins in human retinal cells. Therefore, we sought to generate retinal organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a screening tool to explore the membrane trafficking efficacy of some recently described microbial opsins. We tested both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing microbial opsins including CatCh, ChrimsonR, ReaChR, eNpHR 3.0, and Jaws. The membrane localization of eNpHR 3.0, ReaChR, and Jaws was the highest, likely due to their additional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) release and membrane trafficking signals. In the case of opsins that were not engineered to improve trafficking efficiency in mammalian cells such as CatCh and ChrimsonR, membrane localization was less efficient. Protein accumulation in organelles such as ER and Golgi was observed at high doses with CatCh and ER retention lead to an unfolded protein response. Also, cytoplasmic localization was observed at high doses of ChrimsonR. Our results collectively suggest that retinal organoids derived from hiPSCs can be used to predict the subcellular fate of optogenetic proteins in a human retinal context. Such organoids are also versatile tools to validate other gene therapy products and drug molecules. Pharmacometabolomics Informs Viromics toward Precision Medicine Nowadays, we are experiencing the big data era with the emerging challenge of single data interpretation. Although the advent of high-throughput technologies as well as chemo- and bio- informatics tools presents pan-omics data as the way forward to precision medicine, personalized health care and tailored-made therapeutics can be only envisaged when interindividual variability in response to/ toxicity of xenobiotics can be interpreted and thus, predicted. We know that such variability is the net outcome of genetics (host and microbiota) and environmental factors (diet, lifestyle, polypharmacy, microbiota) and for this, tremendous efforts have been made to clarify key-molecules from correlation to causality to clinical significance. Herein, we focus on the host-microbiome interplay and its direct and indirect impact on efficacy and toxicity of xenobiotics and we inevitably wonder about the role of viruses, as the least acknowledged ones. We present the emerging discipline of pharmacometabolomics-informed viromics, in which pre-dose metabotypes can assist modeling and prediction of interindividual response to/ toxicity of xenobiotics. Such features, either alone or in combination with host genetics, can power biomarker discovery so long as the features are variable among patients, stable enough to be of predictive value, and better than pre-existing tools for predicting therapeutic efficacy/ toxicity. A Clinical-Genetic Score to Identify Surgically Resected Colorectal Cancer Patients Benefiting From an Adjuvant Fluoropyrimidine-Based Therapy There are clinical challenges related to adjuvant treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC) and novel molecular markers are needed for better risk stratification of patients. Our aim was to integrate our previously reported clinical-genetic prognostic score with new immunogenetic markers of 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) to evaluate the recurrence risk stratification before fluoropyrimidine (FL)-based adjuvant therapy. The study population included a total of 270 stage II-III CRC patients treated with adjuvant FL with (FL + OXA, n = 119) or without oxaliplatin (FL, n = 151). Patients were genotyped for a panel of 192 tagging polymorphisms in 34 immune-related genes. The IFNG-rs1861494 polymorphism was associated with worse DFS in the FL + OXA (HR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.13–4.08; P = 0.020, q-value = 0.249) and FL (HR = 1.97, 95%CI 1.00–3.86; P = 0.049) cohorts, according to a dominant model. The integration of IFNG-rs1861494 in our previous clinical genetic multiparametric score of DFS improved the patients’ risk stratification (Log-rank P = 0.0026 in the pooled population). These findings could improve the discrimination of patients who would benefit from adjuvant treatment. In addition, the results may help better elucidate the interplay between the immune system and chemotherapeutics and help determine the efficacy of anti-tumor strategies. Computational Methods for the Pharmacogenetic Interpretation of Next Generation Sequencing Data Up to half of all patients do not respond to pharmacological treatment as intended. A substantial fraction of these inter-individual differences is due to heritable factors and a growing number of associations between genetic variations and drug response phenotypes have been identified. Importantly, the rapid progress in Next Generation Sequencing technologies in recent years unveiled the true complexity of the genetic landscape in pharmacogenes with tens of thousands of rare genetic variants. As each individual was found to harbor numerous such rare variants they are anticipated to be important contributors to the genetically encoded inter-individual variability in drug effects. The fundamental challenge however is their functional interpretation due to the sheer scale of the problem that renders systematic experimental characterization of these variants currently unfeasible. Here, we review concepts and important progress in the development of computational prediction methods that allow to evaluate the effect of amino acid sequence alterations in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. In addition, we discuss recent advances in the interpretation of functional effects of non-coding variants, such as variations in splice sites, regulatory regions and miRNA binding sites. We anticipate that these methodologies will provide a useful toolkit to facilitate the integration of the vast extent of rare genetic variability into drug response predictions in a precision medicine framework. Integrating Next-Generation Sequencing in the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Workflow Pharmacogenomics has been recognized as a fundamental tool in the era of personalized medicine with up to 266 drug labels, approved by major regulatory bodies, currently containing pharmacogenomics information. Next-generation sequencing analysis assumes a critical role in personalized medicine, providing a comprehensive profile of an individual’s variome, particularly that of clinical relevance, comprising of pathogenic variants and pharmacogenomic biomarkers. Here, we propose a strategy to integrate next-generation sequencing into the current clinical pharmacogenomics workflow from deep resequencing to pharmacogenomics consultation, according to the existing guidelines and recommendations. Application of Economic Evaluation to Assess Feasibility for Reimbursement of Genomic Testing as Part of Personalized Medicine Interventions Background: The incorporation of genomic testing into clinical practice constitutes an opportunity to improve patients\\' lives, as it makes possible the implementation of innovative, individualized clinical interventions that maximize efficacy and/or minimize the risk of adverse drug reactions. In order to ensure equal access to genomic testing for all patients, the costs associated with these tests should be reimbursed by their respective national healthcare systems. Given that funding for the public health sector is decreasing in real terms, it is of paramount importance that the emerging interventions are thoroughly evaluated both in terms of their clinical effectiveness and their full economic cost. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify those genome-guided interventions that could be adopted and reimbursed by national healthcare systems. Further, we recorded the underlying factors determining the broad adoption of genome-guided interventions in clinical practice, in order to identify potential reimbursement criteria. Methods: We performed a systematic review of published (PubMed-listed) scientific articles on the economic evaluation of those individualized clinical interventions that include genomic tests. Information on genomic tests reimbursed by the US Medicare program was also included. Subsequently, we correlated the regulatory guidance given for the interventions collated in our systematic review with the corresponding economic evaluation results and policies of the Medicare program. Regulatory guidance information was collected from the PharmGKB online knowledgebase and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). Results: Most of the included studies constitute cost-utility analyses, in which the outcome of the interventions has been measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) whereas an estimate of the total cost has been based upon direct medical cost data. Favorable economic evaluation results, as well as concrete evidence demonstrating the clinical utility of pre-emptive genotyping, are considered as prerequisites for the broad adoption and reimbursement of the costs incurred during genomic testing. Indicatively, pre-emptive HLA-B*5701 and TPMT testing before administration of abacavir and azathioprine, respectively, is reimbursed by Medicare based on both economic and efficacy evidence. Likewise, the medical necessary screening for MMR and BRCA1/2 genes are reimbursed for high-risk populations. Conclusions: Our findings further underline the need for further cost-utility analyses within different national healthcare systems, in order to promote the reimbursement of the cost of innovative genome-guided therapeutic interventions. A Comparison of Fully-Coupled 3D In-Stent Restenosis Simulations to In-vivo Data We describe our fully-coupled 3D multiscale model of in-stent restenosis, with blood flow simulations coupled to smooth muscle cell proliferation, and report results of numerical simulations performed with this model. This novel model is based on several previously reported 2D models. We study the effects of various parameters on the process of restenosis and compare with in vivo porcine data where we observe good qualitative agreement. We study the effects of stent deployment depth (and related injury score), reendothelization speed, and simulate the effect of stent width. Also we demonstrate that we are now capable to simulate restenosis in real-sized (18 mm long, 2.8 mm wide) vessel geometries. Cellular Level In-silico Modeling of Blood Rheology with An Improved Material Model for Red Blood Cells Many of the intriguing properties of blood originate from its cellular nature. Therefore, accurate modelling of blood flow related phenomena requires a description of the dynamics at the level of individual cells. This, however, presents several computational challenges that can only be addressed by high performance computing. We present Hemocell, a parallel computing framework which implements validated mechanical models for red blood cells and is capable of reproducing the emergent transport characteristics of such a complex cellular system. It is computationally capable of handling large domain sizes, thus it is able to bridge the cell-based micro-scale and macroscopic domains. We introduce a new material model for resolving the mechanical responses of red blood cell membranes under various flow conditions and compare it with a well established model. Our new constitutive model has similar accuracy under relaxed flow conditions, however, it performs better for shear rates over 1500 1/s. We also introduce a new method to generate randomised initial conditions for dense mixtures of different cell types free of initial positioning artefacts. Distinct ECG Phenotypes Identified in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Machine Learning Associate With Arrhythmic Risk Markers Aims: Ventricular arrhythmia triggers sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), yet electrophysiological biomarkers are not used for risk stratification. Our aim was to identify distinct HCM phenotypes based on ECG computational analysis, and characterize differences in clinical risk factors and anatomical differences using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: High-fidelity 12-lead Holter ECGs from 85 HCM patients and 38 healthy volunteers were analyzed using mathematical modeling and computational clustering to identify phenotypic subgroups. Clinical features and the extent and distribution of hypertrophy assessed by CMR were evaluated in the subgroups. Results: QRS morphology alone was crucial to identify three HCM phenotypes with very distinct QRS patterns. Group 1 (n = 44) showed normal QRS morphology, Group 2 (n = 19) showed short R and deep S waves in V4, and Group 3 (n = 22) exhibited short R and long S waves in V4-6, and left QRS axis deviation. However, no differences in arrhythmic risk or distribution of hypertrophy were observed between these groups. Including T wave biomarkers in the clustering, four HCM phenotypes were identified: Group 1A (n = 20), with primary repolarization abnormalities showing normal QRS yet inverted T waves, Group 1B (n = 24), with normal QRS morphology and upright T waves, and Group 2 and Group 3 remaining as before, with upright T waves. Group 1A patients, with normal QRS and inverted T wave, showed increased HCM Risk-SCD scores (1A: 4.0%, 1B: 1.8%, 2: 2.1%, 3: 2.5%, p = 0.0001), and a predominance of coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy (p < 0.0001). HCM patients in Groups 2 and 3 exhibited predominantly septal hypertrophy (85 and 90%, respectively). Conclusion: HCM patients were classified in four subgroups with distinct ECG features. Patients with primary T wave inversion not secondary to QRS abnormalities had increased HCM Risk-SCD scores and coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy, suggesting that primary T wave inversion may increase SCD risk in HCM, rather than T wave inversion secondary to depolarization abnormalities. Computational ECG phenotyping provides insight into the underlying processes captured by the ECG and has the potential to be a novel and independent factor for risk stratification. Left Ventricular Trabeculations Decrease the Wall Shear Stress and Increase the Intra-Ventricular Pressure Drop in CFD Simulations The aim of the present study is to characterize the hemodynamics of left ventricular (LV) geometries to examine the impact of trabeculae and papillary muscles (PMs) on blood flow using high performance computing (HPC). Five pairs of detailed and smoothed LV endocardium models were reconstructed from high-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRI) of ex-vivo human hearts. The detailed model of one LV pair is characterized only by the PMs and few big trabeculae, to represent state of art level of endocardial detail. The other four detailed models obtained include instead endocardial structures measuring ≥1 mm2 in cross-sectional area. The geometrical characterizations were done using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with rigid walls and both constant and transient flow inputs on the detailed and smoothed models for comparison. These simulations do not represent a clinical or physiological scenario, but a characterization of the interaction of endocardial structures with blood flow. Steady flow simulations were employed to quantify the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the LVs and the wall shear stress (WSS). Coherent structures were analyzed using the Q-criterion for both constant and transient flow inputs. Our results show that trabeculae and PMs increase the intra-ventricular pressure drop, reduce the WSS and disrupt the dominant single vortex, usually present in the smoothed-endocardium models, generating secondary small vortices. Given that obtaining high resolution anatomical detail is challenging in-vivo, we propose that the effect of trabeculations can be incorporated into smoothed ventricular geometries by adding a porous layer along the LV endocardial wall. Results show that a porous layer of a thickness of 1.2·10−2 m with a porosity of 20 kg/m2 on the smoothed-endocardium ventricle models approximates the pressure drops, vorticities and WSS observed in the detailed models. Stationary Atrial Fibrillation Properties in the Goat Do Not Entail Stable or Recurrent Conduction Patterns Introduction: Electro-anatomical mapping of the atria is used to identify the substrate of atrial fibrillation (AF). Targeting this substrate by ablation in addition to pulmonary vein ablation did not consistently improve outcome in clinical trials. Generally, the assessment of the substrate is based on short recordings (≤10 s, often even shorter). Thus, targeting the AF substrate assumes spatiotemporal stationarity but little is known about the variability of electrophysiological properties of AF over time. Methods: Atrial fibrillation (AF) was maintained for 3–4 weeks after pericardial electrode implantation in 12 goats. Within a single AF episode 10 consecutive minutes were mapped on the left atrial free wall using a 249-electrode array (2.25 mm inter-electrode spacing). AF cycle length, fractionation index (FI), lateral dissociation, conduction velocity, breakthroughs, and preferentiality of conduction (Pref) were assessed per electrode and AF property maps were constructed. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the 10 AF-property maps was calculated to quantify the degree spatiotemporal stationarity of AF properties. Furthermore, the number of waves and presence of re-entrant circuits were analyzed in the first 60-s file. Comparing conduction patterns over time identified recurrent patterns of AF with the use of recurrence plots. Results: The averages of AF property maps were highly stable throughout the ten 60-s-recordings. Spatiotemporal stationarity was high for all 6 property maps, PCC ranged from 0.66 ± 0.11 for Pref to 0.98 ± 0.01 for FI. High stationarity was lost when AF was interrupted for about 1 h. However, the time delay between the recorded files within one episode did not affect PCC. Yet, multiple waves (7.7 ± 2.3) were present simultaneously within the recording area and during 9.2 ± 11% of the analyzed period a re-entrant circuit was observed. Recurrent patterns occurred rarely and were observed in only 3 out of 12 goats. Conclusions: During non-self-terminating AF in the goat, AF properties were stationary. Since this could not be attributed to stable recurrent conduction patterns during AF, it is suggested that AF properties are determined by anatomical and structural properties of the atria even when the conduction patterns are very variable. Modulation of Cardiac Alternans by Altered Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Release: A Simulation Study Background Cardiac alternans is an important precursor to arrhythmia, facilitating formation of conduction block, and re-entry. Diseased hearts were observed to be particularly vulnerable to alternans, mainly in heart failure or after myocardial infarction. Alternans is typically linked to oscillation of calcium cycling, particularly in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). While the role of SR calcium reuptake in alternans is well established, the role of altered calcium release by ryanodine receptors has not yet been studied extensively. At the same time, there is strong evidence that calcium release is abnormal in heart failure and other heart diseases, suggesting that these changes might play a pro-alternans role. Aims To demonstrate how changes to intracellular calcium release dynamics and magnitude affect alternans vulnerability. Methods We used the state-of-the-art Heijman–Rudy and O’Hara–Rudy computer models of ventricular myocyte, given their detailed representation of calcium handling and their previous utility in alternans research. We modified the models to obtain precise control over SR release dynamics and magnitude, allowing for the evaluation of these properties in alternans formation and suppression. Results Shorter time to peak SR release and shorter release duration decrease alternans vulnerability by improved refilling of releasable calcium within junctional SR; conversely, slow release promotes alternans. Modulating the total amount of calcium released, we show that sufficiently increased calcium release may surprisingly prevent alternans via a mechanism linked to the functional depletion of junctional SR during release. We show that this mechanism underlies differences between “eye-type” and “fork-type” alternans, which were observed in human in vivo and in silico. We also provide a detailed explanation of alternans formation in the given computer models, termed “sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling refractoriness.” The mechanism relies on the steep SR load–release relationship, combined with relatively limited rate of junctional SR refilling. Conclusion Both altered dynamics and magnitude of SR calcium release modulate alternans vulnerability. In particular, slow dynamics of SR release, such as those observed in heart failure, promote alternans. Therefore, acceleration of intracellular calcium release, e.g., via synchronization of calcium sparks, may inhibit alternans in failing hearts and reduce arrhythmia occurrence. The Impact of Left Atrium Appendage Morphology on Stroke Risk Assessment in Atrial Fibrillation: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study Atrial fibrillation (AF) carries out a 5-fold increase in stroke risk, related to embolization of thrombi clotting in left atrium (LA). Left atrial appendage (LAA) is the site with the highest blood stasis which causes thrombus formation. About 90 % of the intracardiac thrombi in patients with cardioembolic events originally develop in the LAA. Recent studies have been focused on the association between LAA anatomical features and stroke risk and provided conflicting results. Haemodynamic and fluid dynamic information on the LA and mostly on the LAA may improve stroke risk stratification. Therefore, the aim of this study was the design and development of a workflow to quantitatively define the influence of the LAA morphology on LA hemodynamics. Five 3D LA anatomical models, obtained from real clinical data, which were clearly different as regard to LAA morphology were used. For each LAA we identified and computed several parameters describing its geometry. Then, one LA chamber model was chosen and a framework was developed to connect the different LAAs belonging to the other four patients to this model. These new anatomical models represented the computational domain for the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study; simulations of the hemodynamics within the LA and LAA were performed in order to evaluate the interplay of the LAA shape on the blood flow characteristics in AF condition. CFD simulations were carried out for five cardiac cycles. Blood velocity, vorticity, LAA orifice velocity, residence time computed in the five models were compared and correlated with LAA morphologies. Results showed that not only complex morphologies were characterized by low velocities, low vorticity and consequently could carry a higher thrombogenic risk; even qualitatively simple morphologies showed a thrombogenic risk equal, or even higher, than more complex auricles. CFD results supported the hypothesis that LAA geometric characteristics plays a key-role in defining thromboembolic risk. LAA geometric parameters could be considered, coupled with the morphological characteristics, for a comprehensive evaluation of the regional blood stasis. The proposed procedure might address the development of a tool for patient-specific stroke risk assessment and preventive treatment in AF patients, relying on morpho-functional defintion of each LAA type. Cardiac Optogenetics and Optical Mapping – Overcoming Spectral Congestion in All-Optical Cardiac Electrophysiology Optogenetic control of the heart is an emergent technology that offers unparalleled spatio-temporal control of cardiac dynamics via light-sensitive ion pumps and channels (opsins). This fast-evolving technique holds broad scope in both clinical and basic research setting. Combination of optogenetics with optical mapping of voltage or calcium fluorescent probes facilitates ‘all-optical’ electrophysiology, allowing precise optogenetic actuation of cardiac tissue with high spatio-temporal resolution imaging of action potential and calcium transient morphology and conduction patterns. In this review, we provide a synopsis of optogenetics and discuss in detail its use and compatibility with optical interrogation of cardiac electrophysiology. We briefly discuss the benefits of all-optical cardiac control and electrophysiological interrogation compared to traditional techniques, and describe mechanisms, unique features and limitations of optically induced cardiac control. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art setup design, challenges in light delivery and filtering, and compatibility of opsins with fluorescent reporters used in optical mapping. The interaction of cardiac tissue with light, and physical and computational approaches to overcome the ‘spectral congestion’ that arises from the combination of optogenetics and optical mapping are discussed. Finally, we summarise recent preclinical work and potential clinical cardiac applications of combined cardiac optogenetics and optical mapping approach. β-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation and Alternans in the Border Zone of a Healed Infarct: An ex vivo Study and Computational Investigation of Arrhythmogenesis Background: Following myocardial infarction (MI), the myocardium is prone to calcium-driven alternans, which typically precedes ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. MI is also associated with remodeling of the sympathetic innervation in the infarct border zone, although how this influences arrhythmogenesis is controversial. We hypothesize that the border zone is most vulnerable to alternans, that β-adrenergic receptor stimulation can suppresses this, and investigate the consequences in terms of arrhythmogenic mechanisms. Methods and Results: Anterior MI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) and allowed to heal over 2 months. This resulted in scar formation, significant (p < 0.05) dilation of the left ventricle, and reduction in ejection fraction compared to sham operated rats (n = 4) on 7 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Dual voltage/calcium optical mapping of post-MI Langendorff perfused hearts (using RH-237 and Rhod2) demonstrated that the border zone was significantly more prone to alternans than the surrounding myocardium at longer cycle lengths, predisposing to spatially heterogeneous alternans. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation with norepinephrine (1 μmol/L) attenuated alternans by 60 [52–65]% [interquartile range] and this was reversed with metoprolol (10 μmol/L, p = 0.008). These results could be reproduced by computer modeling of the border zone based on our knowledge of β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways and their influence on intracellular calcium handling and ion channels. Simulations also demonstrated that β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in this specific region reduced the formation of conduction block and the probability of premature ventricular activation propagation. Conclusion: While high levels of overall cardiac sympathetic drive are a negative prognostic indicator of mortality following MI and during heart failure, β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the infarct border zone reduced spatially heterogeneous alternans, and prevented conduction block and propagation of extrasystoles. This may help explain recent clinical imaging studies using meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 11C-meta-hydroxyephedrine positron emission tomography (PET) which demonstrate that border zone denervation is strongly associated with a high risk of future arrhythmia. Is the Brain a Key Player in Glucose Regulation and Development of Type 2 Diabetes? Ever since Claude Bernards discovery in the mid 19th-century that a lesion in the floor of the third ventricle in dogs led to altered systemic glucose levels, a role of the CNS in whole-body glucose regulation has been acknowledged. However, this finding was later overshadowed by the isolation of pancreatic hormones in the 20th century. Since then, the understanding of glucose homeostasis and pathology has primarily evolved around peripheral mechanism. Due to scientific advances over these last few decades, however, increasing attention has been given to the possibility of the brain as a key player in glucose regulation and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Studies of animals have enabled detailed neuroanatomical mapping of CNS structures involved in glucose regulation and key neuronal circuits and intracellular pathways have been identified. Furthermore, the development of neuroimaging techniques has provided methods to measure changes of activity in specific CNS regions upon diverse metabolic challenges in humans. In this narrative review, we discuss the available evidence on the topic. We conclude that there is much evidence in favor of active CNS involvement in glucose homeostasis but the relative importance of central vs. peripheral mechanisms remains to be elucidated. An increased understanding of this field may lead to new CNS-focusing pharmacologic strategies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. MRI-Based Computational Torso/Biventricular Multiscale Models to Investigate the Impact of Anatomical Variability on the ECG QRS Complex Aims:Patient-to-patient anatomical differences are an important source of variability in the electrocardiogram, and they may compromise the identification of pathological electrophysiological abnormalities. This study aims at quantifying the contribution of variability in ventricular and torso anatomies to differences in QRS complexes of the 12-lead ECG using computer simulations. Methods:A computational pipeline is presented that enables computer simulations using human torso/biventricular anatomically based electrophysiological models from clinically standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ventricular model includes membrane kinetics represented by the biophysically detailed O’Hara Rudy model modified for tissue heterogeneity and includes fiber orientation based on the Streeter rule. A population of 265 torso/biventricular models was generated by combining ventricular and torso anatomies obtained from clinically standard MRIs, augmented with a statistical shape model of the body. 12-lead ECGs were simulated on the 265 human torso/biventricular electrophysiology models, and QRS morphology,duration and amplitude were quantified in each ECG lead for each of the human torso-biventricular models. Results:QRS morphologies in limb leads are mainly determined by ventricular anatomy,while in the precordial leads, and especially V1 to V4, they are determined by heart position within the torso. Differences in ventricular orientation within the torso can explain morphological variability from monophasic to biphasic QRS complexes. QRS duration ismainly influenced by myocardial volume, while it is hardly affected by the torso anatomyor position. An average increase of 0.12±0.05 ms in QRS duration is obtained for eachcm3of myocardial volume across all the leads while it hardly changed due to changes in torso volume. Conclusion:Computer simulations using populations of human torso/biventricular models based on clinical MRI enable quantification of anatomical causes of variability in the QRS complex of the 12-lead ECG. The human models presented also pave theway toward their use as testbeds in silico clinical trials Medical and Dietary Uses of N-Acetylcysteine N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a plant antioxidant naturally found in onion, is a precursor to glutathione. It has been used as a drug since the 1960s and is listed on the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines as an antidote in poisonings. There are numerous other uses or proposed uses in medicine that are still in preclinical and clinical investigations. NAC is also used in food supplements and cosmetics. Despite its abundant use, there are projections that the NAC global market will grow in the next five years; therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a balanced view of further uses of NAC as a dietary supplement. Although NAC is considered a safe substance, the results among clinical trials are sometimes controversial or incomplete, like for many other antioxidants. More clinical trials are underway that will improve our understanding of NAC applicability. Numerical Investigation of the Effects of Red Blood Cell Cytoplasmic Viscosity Contrasts on Single Cell and Bulk Transport Behaviour In-silico cellular models of blood are invaluable to gain understanding about the many interesting properties that blood exhibits. However, numerical investigations that focus on the effects of cytoplasmic viscosity in these models are not very prevalent. We present a parallelised method to implement cytoplasmic viscosity for HemoCell, an open-source cellular model based on immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann methods, using an efficient ray-casting algorithm. The effects of the implementation are investigated with single-cell simulations focusing on the deformation in shear flow, the migration due to wall induced lift forces, the characteristic response time in periodic stretching and pair collisions between red blood cells and platelets. Collective transport phenomena are also investigated in many-cell simulations in a pressure driven channel flow. The simulations indicate that the addition of a viscosity contrast between internal and external fluids significantly affects the deformability of a red blood cell, which is most pronounced during very short time-scale events. Therefore, modelling the cytoplasmic viscosity contrast is important in scenarios with high velocity deformation, typically high shear rate flows. From Tropospheric Folding to Khamsin and Foehn Winds: How Atmospheric Dynamics Advanced a Record-Breaking Dust Episode in Crete 3 at the background station of Finokalia. We present here a detailed analysis of the atmospheric dynamical processes during this period, to identify the main reasons for such extreme dust advection over Crete. At the synoptic scale, the weakening of the polar vortex and the meridional transport of polar air masses at upper tropospheric layers resulted in a strong jet streak over north Africa and Central Mediterranean and corresponding tropospheric folding that brought cold stratospheric air in mid and upper troposphere. Cyclogenesis occurred at the Gulf of Sirte in Libya, resulting in strong winds over the north-east parts of Libya, enhancing particle emissions. The dust plume traveled at low altitude (0.5&ndash The Role of PGC-1α and Mitochondrial Biogenesis in Kidney Diseases Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the fastest growing causes of death worldwide, emphasizing the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. CKD predisposes to acute kidney injury (AKI) and AKI favors CKD progression. Mitochondrial derangements are common features of both AKI and CKD and mitochondria-targeting therapies are under study as nephroprotective agents. PGC-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and an attractive therapeutic target. Low PGC-1α levels and decreased transcription of its gene targets have been observed in both preclinical AKI (nephrotoxic, endotoxemia, and ischemia-reperfusion) and in experimental and human CKD, most notably diabetic nephropathy. In mice, PGC-1α deficiency was associated with subclinical CKD and predisposition to AKI while PGC-1α overexpression in tubular cells protected from AKI of diverse causes. Several therapeutic strategies may increase kidney PGC-1α activity and have been successfully tested in animal models. These include AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, and anti-TWEAK antibodies. In conclusion, low PGC-1α activity appears to be a common feature of AKI and CKD and recent characterization of nephroprotective approaches that increase PGC-1α activity may pave the way for nephroprotective strategies potentially effective in both AKI and CKD. Perspective: Mitochondria-ER Contacts in Metabolic Cellular Stress Assessed by Microscopy The interplay of mitochondria with the endoplasmic reticulum and their connections, called mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) or mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), are crucial hubs in cellular stress. These sites are essential for the passage of calcium ions, reactive oxygen species delivery, the sorting of lipids in whole-body metabolism. In this perspective article, we focus on microscopic evidences of the pivotal role of MERCs/MAMs and their changes in metabolic diseases, like obesity, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Zebrafish in Inflammasome Research Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that regulate inflammatory responses to danger stimuli and infection, and their dysregulation is associated with an increasing number of autoinflammatory diseases. In recent years, zebrafish models of human pathologies to study inflammasome function in vivo have started to emerge. Here, we discuss inflammasome research in zebrafish in light of current knowledge about mammalian inflammasomes. We summarize the evolutionary conservation of inflammasome components between zebrafish and mammals, highlighting the similarities and possible divergence in functions of these components. We present new insights into the evolution of the caspase-1 family in the teleost lineage, and how its evolutionary origin may help contextualize its functions. We also review existing infectious and non-infectious models in zebrafish in which inflammasomes have been directly implicated. Finally, we discuss the advantages of zebrafish larvae for intravital imaging of inflammasome activation and summarize available tools that will help to advance inflammasome research. Melatonin Effects on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Are Related to MicroRNA-34a-5p/Sirt1 Axis and Autophagy Melatonin, an indole produced by pineal and extrapineal tissues, but also taken with a vegetarian diet, has strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesogenic potentials. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic side of the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a still reversible phase but may evolve into steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and carcinoma. Currently, an effective therapy for blocking NAFLD staging is lacking. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase, modulates the energetic metabolism in the liver. Micro-RNA-34a-5p, a direct inhibitor of SIRT1, is an emerging indicator of NAFLD grading. Thus, here we analyzed the effects of oral melatonin against NAFLD and underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on steatosis, ER stress, mitochondrial shape and autophagy. Male C57BL/6J (WT) and SIRT1 heterozygous (HET) mice were placed either on a high-fat diet (58.4% energy from lard) (HFD) or on a standard maintenance diet (8.4% energy from lipids) for 16 weeks, drinking melatonin (10 mg/kg) or not. Indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance, steatosis, inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial changes, autophagy and microRNA-34a-5p expression were estimated. Melatonin improved hepatic metabolism and steatosis, influenced ER stress and mitochondrial shape, and promoted autophagy in WT HFD mice. Conversely, melatonin was ineffective in HET HFD mice, maintaining NASH changes. Indeed, autophagy was inconsistent in HET HFD or starved mice, as indicated by LC3II/LC3I ratio, p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosomes estimation. The beneficial role of melatonin in dietary induced NAFLD/NASH in mice was related to reduced expression of microRNA-34a-5p and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1) but only in the presence of full SIRT1 availability. Avian MHC Evolution in the Era of Genomics: Phase 1.0 Birds are a wonderfully diverse and accessible clade with an exceptional range of ecologies and behaviors, making the study of the avian major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of great interest. In the last 20 years, particularly with the advent of high-throughput sequencing, the avian MHC has been explored in great depth in several dimensions: its ability to explain ecological patterns in nature, such as mating preferences; its correlation with parasite resistance; and its structural evolution across the avian tree of life. Here, we review the latest pulse of avian MHC studies spurred by high-throughput sequencing. Despite high-throughput approaches to MHC studies, substantial areas remain in need of improvement with regard to our understanding of MHC structure, diversity, and evolution. Recent studies of the avian MHC have nonetheless revealed intriguing connections between MHC structure and life history traits, and highlight the advantages of long-term ecological studies for understanding the patterns of MHC variation in the wild. Given the exceptional diversity of birds, their accessibility, and the ease of sequencing their genomes, studies of avian MHC promise to improve our understanding of the many dimensions and consequences of MHC variation in nature. However, significant improvements in assembling complete MHC regions with long-read sequencing will be required for truly transformative studies. Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose Metabolism: Beyond Weight Gain Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy. However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics. Pharmacist-Initiated Pre-Emptive Pharmacogenetic Panel Testing with Clinical Decision Support in Primary Care: Record of PGx Results and Real-World Impact Logistics and (cost-)effectiveness of pharmacogenetic (PGx)-testing may be optimized when delivered through a pre-emptive panel-based approach, within a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Here, clinical recommendations are automatically deployed by the CDSS when a drug-gene interaction (DGI) is encountered. However, this requires record of PGx-panel results in the electronic medical record (EMR). Several studies indicate promising clinical utility of panel-based PGx-testing in polypharmacy and psychiatry, but is undetermined in primary care. Therefore, we aim to quantify both the feasibility and the real-world impact of this approach in primary care. Within a prospective pilot study, community pharmacists were provided the opportunity to request a panel of eight pharmacogenes to guide drug dispensing within a CDSS for 200 primary care patients. In this side-study, this cohort was cross-sectionally followed-up after a mean of 2.5-years. PGx-panel results were successfully recorded in 96% and 68% of pharmacist and general practitioner (GP) EMRs, respectively. This enabled 97% of patients to (re)use PGx-panel results for at least one, and 33% for up to four newly initiated prescriptions with possible DGIs. A total of 24.2% of these prescriptions had actionable DGIs, requiring pharmacotherapy adjustment. Healthcare utilization seemed not to vary among those who did and did not encounter a DGI. Pre-emptive panel-based PGx-testing is feasible and real-world impact is substantial in primary care. A Knowledge-Based Machine Learning Approach to Gene Prioritisation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease of the upper and lower motor neurons resulting in death from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within two to five years of first symptoms. Several rare disruptive gene variants have been associated with ALS and are responsible for about 15% of all cases. Although our knowledge of the genetic landscape of this disease is improving, it remains limited. Machine learning models trained on the available protein–protein interaction and phenotype-genotype association data can use our current knowledge of the disease genetics for the prediction of novel candidate genes. Here, we describe a knowledge-based machine learning method for this purpose. We trained our model on protein–protein interaction data from IntAct, gene function annotation from Gene Ontology, and known disease-gene associations from DisGeNet. Using several sets of known ALS genes from public databases and a manual review as input, we generated a list of new candidate genes for each input set. We investigated the relevance of the predicted genes in ALS by using the available summary statistics from the largest ALS genome-wide association study and by performing functional and phenotype enrichment analysis. The predicted sets were enriched for genes associated with other neurodegenerative diseases known to overlap with ALS genetically and phenotypically, as well as for biological processes associated with the disease. Moreover, using ALS genes from ClinVar and our manual review as input, the predicted sets were enriched for ALS-associated genes (ClinVar p = 0.038 and manual review p = 0.060) when used for gene prioritisation in a genome-wide association study. Definitions of Normal Liver Fat and the Association of Insulin Sensitivity with Acquired and Genetic NAFLD—A Systematic Review Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance and therefore predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD can also be caused by common genetic variants, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) or the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). Since NAFL, irrespective of its cause, can progress to NASH and liver fibrosis, its definition is of interest. We reviewed the literature to identify data on definition of normal liver fat using liver histology and different imaging tools, and analyzed whether NAFLD caused by the gene variants is associated with insulin resistance. Histologically, normal liver fat content in liver biopsies is most commonly defined as macroscopic steatosis in less than 5% of hepatocytes. In the population-based Dallas Heart Study, the upper 95th percentile of liver fat measured by proton magnetic spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in healthy subjects was 5.6%, which corresponds to approximately 15% histological liver fat. When measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques such as the proton density fat fraction (PDFF), 5% macroscopic steatosis corresponds to a PDFF of 6% to 6.4%. In contrast to “Obese/metabolic NAFLD”, NAFLD caused by genetic variants is not associated with insulin resistance. This implies that NAFLD is heterogeneous and that “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” but not NAFLD due to the PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 genetic variants predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Reduced Fluorescent Protein Switching Fatigue by Binding-Induced Emissive State Stabilization Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) enable advanced fluorescence imaging, though the performance of this imaging crucially depends on the properties of the labels. We report on the use of an existing small binding peptide, named Enhancer, to modulate the spectroscopic properties of the recently developed rsGreen series of RSFPs. Fusion constructs of Enhancer with rsGreen1 and rsGreenF revealed an increased molecular brightness and pH stability, although expression in living E. coli or HeLa cells resulted in a decrease of the overall emission. Surprisingly, Enhancer binding also increased off-switching speed and resistance to switching fatigue. Further investigation suggested that the RSFPs can interconvert between fast- and slow-switching emissive states, with the overall protein population gradually converting to the slow-switching state through irradiation. The Enhancer modulates the spectroscopic properties of both states, but also preferentially stabilizes the fast-switching state, supporting the increased fatigue resistance. This work demonstrates how the photo-physical properties of RSFPs can be influenced by their binding to other small proteins, which opens up new horizons for applications that may require such modulation. Furthermore, we provide new insights into the photoswitching kinetics that should be of general consideration when developing new RSFPs with improved or different photochromic properties. Recombinant Zika NS1 Protein Secreted from Vero Cells Is Efficient for Inducing Production of Immune Serum Directed against NS1 Dimer International audience; Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that recently emerged in the South Pacific, Americas, and Caribbean islands, where the larger epidemics were documented. ZIKV infection in humans is responsible for neurological disorders and microcephaly. Flavivirus NS1 is a non-structural glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface and secreted as a hexameric lipoprotein particle. Intracellular NS1 exists as a dimer that is required for viral replication, whereas the secreted NS1 hexamer interacts with host factors, leading to pathophysiological conditions. In an effort to dispose of specific anti-ZIKV NS1 immune serum, Vero cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the NS1 gene from an epidemic strain of ZIKV. We showed that stably transduced Vero/ZIKV NS1 cell clone was efficient in the secretion of recombinant NS1 oligomer. Immunization of adult rat with purified extracellular NS1 developed anti-ZIKV antibodies that specifically react with the NS1 dimer produced in human cells infected with African and Asian strains of ZIKV. The rat antibody against ZIKV NS1 dimer is a reliable biological tool that enables the immunological detection of secreted NS1 from host-cells infected with ZIKV. AAV-Mediated Gene Delivery to 3D Retinal Organoids Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) promise a great number of future applications to investigate retinal development, pathophysiology and cell therapies for retinal degenerative diseases. Specific approaches to genetically modulate hiPSC would be valuable for all of these applications. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) have shown the ability for gene delivery to retinal organoids derived from hiPSCs. Thus far, little work has been carried out to investigate mechanisms of AAV-mediated gene delivery and the potential advantages of engineered AAVs to genetically modify retinal organoids. In this study, we compared the early transduction efficiency of several recombinant and engineered AAVs in hiPSC-derived RPE cells and retinal organoids in relation to the availability of their cell-surface receptors and as a function of time. The genetic variant AAV2-7m8 had a superior transduction efficiency when applied at day 44 of differentiation on retinal organoids and provided long-lasting expressions for at least 4 weeks after infection without compromising cell viability. All of the capsids we tested transduced the hiPSC-RPE cells, with the AAV2-7m8 variant being the most efficient. Transduction efficiency was correlated with the presence of primary cell-surface receptors on the hiPS-derived organoids. Our study explores some of the mechanisms of cell attachment of AAVs and reports long-term gene expression resulting from gene delivery in retinal organoids. Zinc Differentially Modulates the Assembly of Soluble and Polymerized Vimentin The intermediate filament protein vimentin constitutes a critical sensor for electrophilic and oxidative stress. We previously showed that vimentin interacts with zinc, which affects its assembly and redox sensing. Here, we used vimentin wt and C328S, an oxidation-resistant mutant showing improved NaCl-induced polymerization, to assess the impact of zinc on soluble and polymerized vimentin by light scattering and electron microscopy. Zinc acts as a switch, reversibly inducing the formation of vimentin oligomeric species. High zinc concentrations elicit optically-detectable vimentin structures with a characteristic morphology depending on the support. These effects also occur in vimentin C328S, but are not mimicked by magnesium. Treatment of vimentin with micromolar ZnCl2 induces fibril-like particles that do not assemble into filaments, but form aggregates upon subsequent addition of NaCl. In contrast, when added to NaCl-polymerized vimentin, zinc increases the diameter or induces lateral association of vimentin wt filaments. Remarkably, these effects are absent or attenuated in vimentin C328S filaments. Therefore, the zinc-vimentin interaction depends on the chemical environment and on the assembly state of the protein, leading to atypical polymerization of soluble vimentin, likely through electrostatic interactions, or to broadening and lateral association of preformed filaments through mechanisms requiring the cysteine residue. Thus, the impact of zinc on vimentin assembly and redox regulation is envisaged. Activation of the Alternate Renin-Angiotensin System Correlates with the Clinical Status in Human Cirrhosis and Corrects Post Liver Transplantation Introduction: Recent animal studies have shown that the alternate renin-angiotensin system (RAS) consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) and the Mas receptor is upregulated in cirrhosis and contributes to splanchnic vasodilatation and portal hypertension. To determine the potential relevance of these findings to human liver disease, we evaluated its expression and relationship to the patients’ clinical status in subjects with cirrhosis. Methods: Blood sampling from peripheral and central vascular beds was performed intra-operatively for cirrhotic patients at the time of liver transplantation (LT) or trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures to measure angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1–7) peptide levels and ACE and ACE2 enzyme activity. Relevant clinical and hemodynamic data were recorded pre-operatively for all subjects and peripheral blood sampling was repeated 3 months or later post-operatively. Results: Ang-(1–-7) and ACE2 activity were up-regulated more than twofold in cirrhotic subjects both at the time of LT and TIPS and levels returned to comparable levels as control subjects post-transplantation. Ang-(1–7) levels correlated positively with the degree of liver disease severity, as measured by the model for an end-stage liver disease (MELD) and also with clinical parameters of pathological vasodilatation including cardiac output (CO). There were strong correlations found between the ACE2:ACE and the Ang-(1–7):Ang II ratio highlighting the inter-dependence of the alternate and classical arms of the RAS and thus their potential impact on vascular tone. Conclusions: In human cirrhosis, the alternate RAS is markedly upregulated and the activation of this system is associated strongly with features of the hyperdynamic circulation in advanced human cirrhosis. Assessing the Implementation of Pharmacogenomic Panel-Testing in Primary Care in the Netherlands Utilizing a Theoretical Framework Despite overcoming many implementation barriers, pharmacogenomic (PGx) panel-testing is not routine practice in the Netherlands. Therefore, we aim to study pharmacists’ perceived enablers and barriers for PGx panel-testing among pharmacists participating in a PGx implementation study. Here, pharmacists identify primary care patients, initiating one of 39 drugs with a Dutch Pharmacogenetic Working Group (DPWG) recommendation and subsequently utilizing the results of a 12 gene PGx panel test to guide dose and drug selection. Pharmacists were invited for a general survey and a semi-structured interview based on the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework, aiming to identify implementation enablers and barriers, if they had managed at least two patients with actionable PGx results. In total, 15 semi-structured interviews were performed before saturation point was reached. Of these, five barrier themes emerged: (1) unclear procedures, (2) undetermined reimbursement for PGx test and consult, (3) insufficient evidence of clinical utility for PGx panel-testing, (4) infrastructure inefficiencies, and (5) HCP PGx knowledge and awareness; and two enabler themes: (1) pharmacist perceived role in delivering PGx, and (2) believed clinical utility of PGx. Despite a strong belief in the beneficial effects of PGx, pharmacists’ barriers remain, an these hinder implementation in primary care. Synthesis and Characterization of Ethylenedithio-MPTTF-PTM Radical Dyad as a Potential Neutral Radical Conductor During the last years there has been a high interest in the development of new purely-organic single-component conductors. Very recently, we have reported a new neutral radical conductor based on the perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical moiety linked to a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) unit by a π-conjugated bridge (1) that behaves as a semiconductor under high pressure. With the aim of developing a new material with improved conducting properties, we have designed and synthesized the radical dyad 2 which was functionalized with an ethylenedithio (EDT) group in order to improve the intermolecular interactions of the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) subunits. The physical properties of the new radical dyad 2 were studied in detail in solution to further analyze its electronic structure. Metabolic Modeling of Human Gut Microbiota on a Genome Scale: An Overview There is growing interest in the metabolic interplay between the gut microbiome and host metabolism. Taxonomic and functional profiling of the gut microbiome by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has unveiled substantial richness and diversity. However, the mechanisms underlying interactions between diet, gut microbiome and host metabolism are still poorly understood. Genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) is an emerging approach that has been increasingly applied to infer diet–microbiome, microbe–microbe and host–microbe interactions under physiological conditions. GSMM can, for example, be applied to estimate the metabolic capabilities of microbes in the gut. Here, we discuss how meta-omics datasets such as shotgun metagenomics, can be processed and integrated to develop large-scale, condition-specific, personalized microbiota models in healthy and disease states. Furthermore, we summarize various tools and resources available for metagenomic data processing and GSMM, highlighting the experimental approaches needed to validate the model predictions. Computational Drug Design Applied to the Study of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are a family of eight GPCRs that are attractive drug discovery targets to modulate glutamate action and response. Here we review the application of computational methods to the study of this family of receptors. X-ray structures of the extracellular and 7-transmembrane domains have played an important role to enable structure-based modeling approaches, whilst we also discuss the successful application of ligand-based methods. We summarize the literature and highlight the areas where modeling and experiment have delivered important understanding for mGlu receptor drug discovery. Finally, we offer suggestions of future areas of opportunity for computational work. Out-of-Plane Aptamer Functionalization of RNA Three-Helix Tiles Co-transcriptionally folding RNA nanostructures have great potential as biomolecular scaffolds, which can be used to organize small molecules or proteins into spatially ordered assemblies. Here, we develop an RNA tile composed of three parallel RNA double helices, which can associate into small hexagonal assemblies via kissing loop interactions between its two outer helices. The inner RNA helix is modified with an RNA motif found in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which provides a 90° bend. This modification is used to functionalize the RNA structures with aptamers pointing perpendicularly away from the tile plane. We demonstrate modifications with the fluorogenic malachite green and Spinach aptamers as well with the protein-binding PP7 and streptavidin aptamers. The modified structures retain the ability to associate into larger assemblies, representing a step towards RNA hybrid nanostructures extending in three dimensions. Taurine Supplementation Alleviates Puromycin Aminonucleoside Damage by Modulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial-Related Apoptosis in Rat Kidney Taurine (TAU) is a sulfur-containing beta amino acid that is not involved in protein composition and anabolism, conditionally essential in mammals provided through diet. Growing evidence supports a protective role of TAU supply in osmoregulation, calcium flux, and reduction of inflammation and oxidant damage in renal diseases like diabetes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to abnormal proteostasis, is a contributor to nephrotic syndrome and related renal damage. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary TAU (1.5% in drinking water for 15 days) in an established rat model that mimics human minimal change nephrosis, consisting of a single puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) injection (intraperitoneally 15 mg/100 g body weight), with sacrifice after eight days. TAU limited proteinuria and podocytes foot processes effacement, and balanced slit diaphragm nephrin and glomerular claudin 1 expressions. In cortical proximal tubules, TAU improved lysosomal density, ER perimeter, restored proper ER-mitochondria tethering and mitochondrial cristae, and decreased inflammation. Remarkably, TAU downregulated glomerular ER stress markers (GRP78, GRP94), pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein, activated caspase 3, tubular caspase1, and mitochondrial chaperone GRP75, but maintained anti-apoptotic HSP25. In conclusion, TAU, by targeting upstream ER stress separate from mitochondria dysfunctions at crucial renal sites, might be a promising dietary supplement in the treatment of the drug-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Nutritional Modulation of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Insulin Resistance Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of disorders ranging from simple steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFL increases the risk of liver fibrosis. If the liver is fatty due to causes of insulin resistance such as obesity and physical inactivity, it overproduces glucose and triglycerides leading to hyperinsulinemia and a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration. The latter features predispose to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Understanding the impact of nutritional modulation of liver fat content and insulin resistance is therefore of interest for prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Hypocaloric, especially low carbohydrate ketogenic diets rapidly decrease liver fat content and associated metabolic abnormalities. However, any type of caloric restriction seems effective long-term. Isocaloric diets containing 16%-23% fat and 57%-65% carbohydrate lower liver fat compared to diets with 43%-55% fat and 27%-38% carbohydrate. Diets rich in saturated (SFA) as compared to monounsaturated (MUFA) or polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids appear particularly harmful as they increase both liver fat and insulin resistance. Overfeeding either saturated fat or carbohydrate increases liver fat content. Vitamin E supplementation decreases liver fat content as well as fibrosis but has no effect on features of insulin resistance. Glucose and Lipid Dysmetabolism in a Rat Model of Prediabetes Induced by a High-Sucrose Diet [Abstract] Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity are key features of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but their molecular nature during the early stages of the disease remains to be elucidated. We aimed to characterize glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-target organs (liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue) in a rat model treated with a high-sucrose (HSu) diet. Two groups of 16-week-old male Wistar rats underwent a 9-week protocol: HSu diet (n = 10)—received 35% of sucrose in drinking water; Control (n = 12)—received vehicle (water). Body weight, food, and beverage consumption were monitored and glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles were measured. Serum and liver triglyceride concentrations, as well as the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis were assessed. The insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis were also measured in freshly isolated adipocytes. Even in the absence of obesity, this rat model already presented the main features of prediabetes, with fasting normoglycemia but reduced glucose tolerance, postprandial hyperglycemia, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, as well as decreased insulin sensitivity (resistance) and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, impaired hepatic function, including altered gluconeogenic and lipogenic pathways, as well as increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 and fatty acid synthase in the liver, were observed, suggesting that liver glucose and lipid dysmetabolism may play a major role at this stage of the disease.

Mosquito-borne arboviruses are increasing due to human disturbances of natural ecosystems and globalization of trade and travel. These anthropic changes may affect mosquito communities by modulating ecological traits that influence the “spill-over” dynamics of zoonotic pathogens, especially at the interface between natural and human environments. Particularly, the global invasion of Aedes albopictus is observed not only across urban and peri-urban settings, but also in newly invaded areas in natural settings. This could foster the interaction of Ae. albopictus with wildlife, including local reservoirs of enzootic arboviruses, with implications for the potential zoonotic transfer of pathogens. To evaluate the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector of arboviruses between wildlife and humans, we performed a bibliographic search and analysis focusing on three components: (1) The capacity of Ae. albopictus to exploit natural larval breeding sites, (2) the blood-feeding behaviour of Ae. albopictus, and (3) Ae. albopictus’ vector competence for arboviruses. Our analysis confirms the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector based on its colonization of natural breeding sites in newly invaded areas, its opportunistic feeding behaviour together with the preference for human blood, and the competence to transmit 14 arboviruses. An Assessment of Atmospheric and Meteorological Factors Regulating Red Sea Phytoplankton Growth This study considers the various factors that regulate nutrients supply in the Red Sea. Multi-sensor observation and reanalysis datasets are used to examine the relationships among dust deposition, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed, as they may contribute to anomalous phytoplankton blooms, through time-series and correlation analyses. A positive correlation was found at 0–3 months lag between chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) anomalies and dust anomalies over the Red Sea regions. Dust deposition process was further examined with dust aerosols’ vertical distribution using satellite lidar data. Conversely, a negative correlation was found at 0–3 months lag between SST anomalies and Chl-a that was particularly strong in the southern Red Sea during summertime. The negative relationship between SST and phytoplankton is also evident in the continuously low levels of Chl-a during 2015 to 2016, which were the warmest years in the region on record. The overall positive correlation between wind speed and Chl-a relate to the nutritious water supply from the Gulf of Aden to the southern Red Sea and the vertical mixing encountered in the northern part. Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) dataset experience some temporal inconsistencies due to the inclusion of different datasets. We addressed those issues in our analysis with a valid interpretation of these complex relationships. Earth-Observation-Based Estimation and Forecasting of Particulate Matter Impact on Solar Energy in Egypt This study estimates the impact of dust aerosols on surface solar radiation and solar energy in Egypt based on Earth Observation (EO) related techniques. For this purpose, we exploited the synergy of monthly mean and daily post processed satellite remote sensing observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations utilizing machine learning, in conjunction with 1-day forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As cloudy conditions in this region are rare, aerosols in particular dust, are the most common sources of solar irradiance attenuation, causing performance issues in the photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) plant installations. The proposed EO-based methodology is based on the solar energy nowcasting system (SENSE) that quantifies the impact of aerosol and dust on solar energy potential by using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of climatological values and day-to-day monitoring and forecasting variability from MODIS and CAMS, respectively. The forecast accuracy was evaluated at various locations in Egypt with substantial PV and CSP capacity installed and found to be within 5–12% of that obtained from the satellite observations, highlighting the ability to use such modelling approaches for solar energy management and planning (M&P). Particulate matter resulted in attenuation by up to 64–107 kWh/m2 for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and 192–329 kWh/m2 for direct normal irradiance (DNI) annually. This energy reduction is climatologically distributed between 0.7% and 12.9% in GHI and 2.9% to 41% in DNI with the maximum values observed in spring following the frequent dust activity of Khamaseen. Under extreme dust conditions the AOD is able to exceed 3.5 resulting in daily energy losses of more than 4 kWh/m2 for a 10 MW system. Such reductions are able to cause financial losses that exceed the daily revenue values. This work aims to show EO capabilities and techniques to be incorporated and utilized in solar energy studies and applications in sun-privileged locations with permanent aerosol sources such as Egypt. Satellite and In Situ Observations for Advancing Global Earth Surface Modelling: A Review In this paper, we review the use of satellite-based remote sensing in combination with in situ data to inform Earth surface modelling. This involves verification and optimization methods that can handle both random and systematic errors and result in effective model improvement for both surface monitoring and prediction applications. The reasons for diverse remote sensing data and products include (i) their complementary areal and temporal coverage, (ii) their diverse and covariant information content, and (iii) their ability to complement in situ observations, which are often sparse and only locally representative. To improve our understanding of the complex behavior of the Earth system at the surface and sub-surface, we need large volumes of data from high-resolution modelling and remote sensing, since the Earth surface exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity and discontinuities in space and time. The spatial and temporal variability of the biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and anthroposphere calls for an increased use of Earth observation (EO) data attaining volumes previously considered prohibitive. We review data availability and discuss recent examples where satellite remote sensing is used to infer observable surface quantities directly or indirectly, with particular emphasis on key parameters necessary for weather and climate prediction. Coordinated high-resolution remote-sensing and modelling/assimilation capabilities for the Earth surface are required to support an international application-focused effort. Low Praziquantel Treatment Coverage for Schistosoma mansoni in Mayuge District, Uganda, Due to the Absence of Treatment Opportunities, Rather Than Systematic Non-Compliance The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends praziquantel mass drug administration (MDA) to control schistosomiasis in endemic regions. We aimed to quantify recent and lifetime praziquantel coverage, and reasons for non-treatment, at an individual level to guide policy recommendations to help Uganda reach WHO goals. Cross-sectional household surveys (n = 681) encompassing 3208 individuals (adults and children) were conducted in 2017 in Bugoto A and B, Mayuge District, Uganda. Participants were asked if they had received praziquantel during the recent MDA (October 2016) and whether they had ever received praziquantel in their lifetime. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with socio-economic and individual characteristics as covariates was used to determine factors associated with praziquantel uptake. In the MDA eligible population (≥5 years of age), the most recent MDA coverage was 48.8%. Across individuals’ lifetimes, 31.8% of eligible and 49.5% of the entire population reported having never taken praziquantel. Factors that improved individuals’ odds of taking praziquantel included school enrolment, residence in Bugoto B and increasing years of village-residency. Not being offered (49.2%) and being away during treatment (21.4%) were the most frequent reasons for not taking the 2016 praziquantel MDA. Contrary to expectations, chronically-untreated individuals were rarely systematic non-compliers, but more commonly not offered treatment. Structural and Functional Basis of the Fidelity of Nucleotide Selection by Flavivirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases International audience; Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) play a central role not only in viral replication, but also in the genetic evolution of viral RNAs. After binding to an RNA template and selecting 5\\'-triphosphate ribonucleosides, viral RdRps synthesize an RNA copy according to Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The copy process sometimes deviates from both the base-pairing rules specified by the template and the natural ribose selectivity and, thus, the process is error-prone due to the intrinsic (in)fidelity of viral RdRps. These enzymes share a number of conserved amino-acid sequence strings, called motifs A-G, which can be defined from a structural and functional point-of-view. A co-relation is gradually emerging between mutations in these motifs and viral genome evolution or observed mutation rates. Here, we review our current knowledge on these motifs and their role on the structural and mechanistic basis of the fidelity of nucleotide selection and RNA synthesis by Flavivirus RdRps. Control of Acute Arboviral Infection by Natural Killer Cells The recent explosive pandemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) followed by Zika (ZIKV) virus infections occurring throughout many countries represents the most unexpected arrival of arthropod-borne viral diseases in the past 20 years. Transmitted through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, the clinical picture associated with these acute arbovirus infections, including Dengue (DENV), CHIKV and ZIKV, ranges from classical febrile illness to life-threatening disease. Whereas ZIKV and CHIKV-mediated infections have previously been recognized as relatively benign diseases, in contrast to Dengue fever, recent epidemic events have brought waves of increased morbidity and mortality leading to a serious public health problem. Although the host immune response plays a crucial role in controlling infections, it may also promote viral spread and immunopathology. Here, we review recent developments in our understanding of the immune response, with an emphasis on the early antiviral immune response mediated by natural killer cells and emphasize their Janus-faced effects in the control of arbovirus infection and pathogenesis. Improving our understanding knowledge on of the mechanisms that control viral infection is crucial in the current race against the globalization of arbovirus epidemics. Assessing the Potential Interactions between Cellular miRNA and Arboviral Genomic RNA in the Yellow Fever Mosquito, Aedes aegypti Although the role of exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) and P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in mosquito antiviral immunity is increasingly better understood, there is still little knowledge regarding the role of mosquito cellular microRNA (miRNA). Identifying direct interactions between the mosquito miRNAs and the RNA genome of arboviruses and choosing the relevant miRNA candidates to explore resulting antiviral mechanisms are critical. Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies. Experimental Assessment of Zika Virus Mechanical Transmission by Aedes aegypti The pandemic emergence of several mosquito-borne viruses highlights the need to understand the different ways in which they can be transmitted by vectors to human hosts. In this study, we evaluated the propensity of Aedes aegypti to transmit mechanically Zika virus (ZIKV) using an experimental design. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on ZIKV-infected blood and were then rapidly transferred to feed on ZIKV-free blood until they finished their meal. The uninfected blood meals, the mosquito abdomens, as well as the mouthparts dissected from fully and partially engorged mosquitoes were analyzed using RT-qPCR and/or virus titration. All the fully engorged mosquito abdomens were ZIKV-infected, whereas their mouthparts were all ZIKV-negative. Nonetheless, one of the partially engorged mosquitoes carried infectious particles on mouthparts. No infectious virus was found in the receiver blood meals, while viral RNA was detected in 9% of the samples (2/22). Thus, mechanical transmission of ZIKV may sporadically occur via Ae. aegypti bite. However, as the number of virions detected on mouthparts (2 particles) is not sufficient to induce infection in a naïve host, our results indicate that mechanical transmission does not impact ZIKV epidemiology. The digital code driven autonomous synthesis of ibuprofen automated in a 3D-printer-based robot An automated synthesis robot was constructed by modifying an open source 3D printing platform. The resulting automated system was used to 3D print reaction vessels (reactionware) of differing internal volumes using polypropylene feedstock via a fused deposition modeling 3D printing approach and subsequently make use of these fabricated vessels to synthesize the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen via a consecutive one-pot three-step approach. The synthesis of ibuprofen could be achieved on different scales simply by adjusting the parameters in the robot control software. The software for controlling the synthesis robot was written in the python programming language and hard-coded for the synthesis of ibuprofen by the method described, opening possibilities for the sharing of validated synthetic ‘programs’ which can run on similar low cost, user-constructed robotic platforms towards an ‘open-source’ regime in the area of chemical synthesis. Application of RNAi and Heat-shock-induced Transcription Factor Expression to Reprogram Germ Cells to Neurons in <em>C. elegans</em> Studying the cell biological processes during converting the identities of specific cell types provides important insights into mechanism that maintain and protect cellular identities. The conversion of germ cells into specific neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a powerful tool for performing genetic screens in order to dissect regulatory pathways that safeguard established cell identities. Reprogramming of germ cells to a specific type of neurons termed ASE requires transgenic animals that allow broad over-expression of the Zn-finger transcription factor (TF) CHE-1. Endogenous CHE-1 is expressed exclusively in two head neurons and is required to specify the glutamatergic ASE neurons fate, which can easily be visualized by the gcy-5prom::gfp reporter. A trans gene containing the heat-shock promoter-driven che-1 gene expression construct allows broad mis-expression of CHE-1 in the entire animal upon heat-shock treatment. The combination of RNAi against the chromatin-regulating factor LIN-53 and heat-shock-induced che-1 over-expression leads to reprogramming of germ cell into ASE neuron-like cells. We describe here the specific RNAi procedure and appropriate conditions for heat-shock treatment of transgenic animals in order to successfully induce germ cell to neuron conversion. A CENSUS OF LARGE-SCALE (≥10 PC), VELOCITY-COHERENT, DENSE FILAMENTS IN THE NORTHERN GALACTIC PLANE: AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION USING MINIMUM SPANNING TREE Large-scale gaseous filaments with length up to the order of 100 pc are on the upper end of the filamentary hierarchy of the Galactic interstellar medium. Their association with respect to the Galactic structure and their role in Galactic star formation are of great interest from both observational and theoretical point of view. Previous \"by-eye\" searches, combined together, have started to uncover the Galactic distribution of large filaments, yet inherent bias and small sample size limit conclusive statistical results to be drawn. Here, we present (1) a new, automated method to identify large-scale velocity-coherent dense filaments, and (2) the first statistics and the Galactic distribution of these filaments. We use a customized minimum spanning tree algorithm to identify filaments by connecting voxels in the position-position-velocity space, using the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey spectroscopic catalog. In the range of _$7.^{\\\\circ}5 \\\\le l \\\\le 194^{\\\\circ}_$, we have identified 54 large-scale filaments and derived mass (_$\\\\sim 10^3 - 10^5 \\\\, M_\\\\odot_$), length (10-276 pc), linear mass density (54-8625 _$M_\\\\odot \\\\, \\\\rm{pc}^{-1}_$), aspect ratio, linearity, velocity gradient, temperature, fragmentation, Galactic location and orientation angle. The filaments concentrate along major spiral arms. They are widely distributed across the Galactic disk, with 50% located within _$\\\\pm_$20 pc from the Galactic mid-plane and 27% run in the center of spiral arms (aka \"bones\"). An order of 1% of the molecular ISM is confined in large filaments. Massive star formation is more favorable in large filaments compared to elsewhere. This is the first comprehensive catalog of large filaments useful for a quantitative comparison with spiral structures and numerical simulations. First Results from BISTRO: A SCUBA-2 Polarimeter Survey of the Gould Belt Accepted: 2017-04-27 The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The Magnetic Field Strength in the Orion A Filament Accepted: 2017-07-17 Relative Alignment between the Magnetic Field and Molecular Gas Structure in the Vela C Giant Molecular Cloud Using Low- and High-density Tracers We compare the magnetic field orientation for the young giant molecular cloud Vela C inferred from 500-_$\\\\mu_$m polarization maps made with the BLASTPol balloon-borne polarimeter to the orientation of structures in the integrated line emission maps from Mopra observations. Averaging over the entire cloud we find that elongated structures in integrated line-intensity, or zeroth-moment maps, for low density tracers such as _$^{12}_$CO and _$^{13}_$CO _$J_$ _$\\\\rightarrow_$ 1 - 0 are statistically more likely to align parallel to the magnetic field, while intermediate or high density tracers show (on average) a tendency for alignment perpendicular to the magnetic field. This observation agrees with previous studies of the change in relative orientation with column density in Vela C, and supports a model where the magnetic field is strong enough to have influenced the formation of dense gas structures within Vela C. The transition from parallel to no preferred/perpendicular orientation appears to happen between the densities traced by _$^{13}_$CO and by C_$^{18}_$O _$J_$ _$\\\\rightarrow_$ 1 - 0. Using RADEX radiative transfer models to estimate the characteristic number density traced by each molecular line we find that the transition occurs at a molecular hydrogen number density of approximately _$10^3_$ cm_$^{-3}_$. We also see that the Centre-Ridge (the highest column density and most active star-forming region within Vela C) appears to have a transition at a lower number density, suggesting that this may depend on the evolutionary state of the cloud. A monolithic algorithm for the simulation of cardiac electromechanics in the human left ventricle In this paper, we propose a monolithic algorithm for the numerical solution of the electromechanics model of the left ventricle in the human heart. Our coupled model integrates the monodomain equation with the Bueno-Orovio minimal model for electrophysiology and the Holzapfel-Ogden constitutive law for the passive mechanics of the myocardium; a distinguishing feature of our electromechanics model is the use of the active strain formulation for muscle contraction, which we exploit – for the first time in this context – by means of a transmurally variable active strain formulation. We use the Finite Element method for space discretization and Backward Differentiation Formulas for time discretization, which we consider for both implicit and semi-implicit schemes. We compare and discuss the two schemes in terms of computational efficiency as the semi-implicit scheme poses significant restrictions on the timestep size due to stability considerations, while the implicit scheme yields instead a nonlinear problem, which we solve by means of the Newton method. Emphasis is laid on preconditioning strategy of the linear solver, which we perform by factorizing a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner in combination with combination with parallel preconditioners for each of the single core models composing the integrated electromechanics model. We carry out several numerical simulations in the High Performance Computing framework for both idealized and patient-specific left ventricle geometries and meshes, which we obtain by segmenting medical MRI images. We produce personalized pressure-volume loops by means of the computational procedure, which we use to synthetically interpret and analyze the outputs of the electromechanics model. Radiative and climate effects of stratospheric sulfur geoengineering using seasonally varying injection areas Abstract. Stratospheric sulfur injections have often been suggested as a cost-effective geoengineering method to prevent or slow down global warming. In geoengineering studies, these injections are commonly targeted to the Equator, where the yearly mean intensity of the solar radiation is the highest and from where the aerosols disperse globally due to the Brewer–Dobson Circulation. However, compensating for greenhouse gas-induced zonal warming by reducing solar radiation would require a relatively larger radiative forcing to the mid- and high latitudes and a lower forcing to the low latitudes than what is achieved by continuous equatorial injections. In this study we employ alternative aerosol injection scenarios to investigate if the resulting radiative forcing can be targeted to be zonally more uniform without decreasing the global the mean radiative forcing of stratospheric sulfur geoengineering. We used a global aerosol–climate model together with an Earth system model to study the radiative and climate effects of stratospheric sulfur injection scenarios with different injection areas. According to our simulations, varying the SO2 injection area seasonally would result in a similar global mean cooling effect as injecting SO2 to the Equator, but with a more uniform zonal distribution of shortwave radiative forcing. Compared to the case of equatorial injections, in the seasonally varying injection scenario where the maximum sulfur production from injected SO2 followed the maximum of solar radiation, the shortwave radiative forcing decreased by 27\\u202f% over the Equator (the latitudes between 20°\\u202fN and 20°\\u202fS) and increased by 15\\u202f% over higher latitudes. Compared to the continuous injections to the Equator, in summer months the radiative forcing was increased by 17 and 14\\u202f% and in winter months decreased by 14 and 16\\u202f% in Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively. However, these forcings do not translate into as large changes in temperatures. The changes in forcing would only lead to 0.05\\u202fK warmer winters and 0.05\\u202fK cooler summers in the Northern Hemisphere, which is roughly 3\\u202f% of the cooling resulting from solar radiation management scenarios studied here. A model intercomparison of CCN-limited tenuous clouds in the high Arctic Abstract. We perform a model intercomparison of summertime high Arctic (>\\u200980∘\\u2009N) clouds observed during the 2008 Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) campaign, when observed cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations fell below 1\\u2009cm−3. Previous analyses have suggested that at these low CCN concentrations the liquid water content (LWC) and radiative properties of the clouds are determined primarily by the CCN concentrations, conditions that have previously been referred to as the tenuous cloud regime. The The The The The The The The intercomparison includes results from three large eddy simulation models (UCLALES-SALSA, COSMO-LES, and MIMICA) and three numerical weather prediction models (COSMO-NWP, WRF, and UM-CASIM). We test the sensitivities of the model results to different treatments of cloud droplet activation, including prescribed cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs) and diagnostic CCN activation based on either fixed aerosol concentrations or prognostic aerosol with in-cloud processing. There remains considerable diversity even in experiments with prescribed CDNCs and prescribed ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC). sensitivity of mixed-phase Arctic cloud properties to changes in CDNC depends on the representation of the cloud droplet size distribution within each model, which impacts autoconversion rates. Our results therefore suggest that properly estimating aerosol–cloud interactions requires an appropriate treatment of the cloud droplet size distribution within models, as well as in situ observations of hydrometeor size distributions to constrain them. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the liquid water content of these clouds is CCN limited. For the observed meteorological conditions, the cloud generally did not collapse when the CCN concentration was held constant at the relatively high CCN concentrations measured during the cloudy period, but the cloud thins or collapses as the CCN concentration is reduced. The CCN concentration at which collapse occurs varies substantially between models. Only one model predicts complete dissipation of the cloud due to glaciation, and this occurs only for the largest prescribed ICNC tested in this study. Global and regional models with either prescribed CDNCs or prescribed aerosol concentrations would not reproduce these dissipation events. Additionally, future increases in Arctic aerosol concentrations would be expected to decrease the frequency of occurrence of such cloud dissipation events, with implications for the radiative balance at the surface. Our results also show that cooling of the sea-ice surface following cloud dissipation increases atmospheric stability near the surface, further suppressing cloud formation. Therefore, this suggests that linkages between aerosol and clouds, as well as linkages between clouds, surface temperatures, and atmospheric stability need to be considered for weather and climate predictions in this region. Nine-year spatial and temporal evolution of desert dust aerosols over South and East Asia as revealed by CALIOP Abstract. We present a\\xa03-D climatology of the desert dust distribution over South and East Asia derived using CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) data. To distinguish desert dust from total aerosol load we apply a\\xa0methodology developed in the framework of EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network). The method involves the use of the particle linear depolarization ratio and updated lidar ratio values suitable for Asian dust, applied to multiyear CALIPSO observations (January 2007–December 2015). The resulting dust product provides information on the horizontal and vertical distribution of dust aerosols over South and East Asia along with the seasonal transition of dust transport pathways. Persistent high D_AOD (dust aerosol optical depth) values at 532\\u2009nm, of the order of 0.6, are present over the arid and semi-arid desert regions. Dust aerosol transport (range, height and intensity) is subject to high seasonality, with the highest values observed during spring for northern China (Taklimakan and Gobi deserts) and during summer over the Indian subcontinent (Thar Desert). Additionally, we decompose the CALIPSO AOD (aerosol optical depth) into dust and non-dust aerosol components to reveal the non-dust AOD over the highly industrialized and densely populated regions of South and East Asia, where the non-dust aerosols yield AOD values of the order of 0.5. Furthermore, the CALIPSO-based short-term AOD and D_AOD time series and trends between January 2007 and December 2015 are calculated over South and East Asia and over selected subregions. Positive trends are observed over northwest and east China and the Indian subcontinent, whereas over southeast China trends are mostly negative. The calculated AOD trends agree well with the trends derived from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), although significant differences are observed over specific regions. Predicting decadal trends in cloud droplet number concentration using reanalysis and satellite data Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is the key state variable that moderates the relationship between aerosol and the radiative forcing arising from aerosol–cloud interactions. Uncertainty related to the effect of anthropogenic aerosol on cloud properties represents the largest uncertainty in total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Here we show that regionally averaged time series of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed CDNC of low, liquid-topped clouds is well predicted by the MERRA2 reanalysis near-surface sulfate mass concentration over decadal timescales. A multiple linear regression between MERRA2 reanalyses masses of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), sea salt (SS), and dust (DU) shows that CDNC across many different regimes can be reproduced by a simple power-law fit to near-surface SO4, with smaller contributions from BC, OC, SS, and DU. This confirms previous work using a less sophisticated retrieval of CDNC on monthly timescales. The analysis is supported by an examination of remotely sensed sulfur dioxide (SO2) over maritime volcanoes and the east coasts of North America and Asia, revealing that maritime CDNC responds to changes in SO2 as observed by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI). This investigation of aerosol reanalysis and top-down remote-sensing observations reveals that emission controls in Asia and North America have decreased CDNC in their maritime outflow on a decadal timescale. Continued increase of CFC-113a (CCl3CF3) mixing ratios in the global atmosphere: emissions, occurrence and potential sources Abstract. Atmospheric measurements of the ozone-depleting substance CFC-113a (CCl3CF3) are reported from ground-based stations in Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, together with aircraft-based data for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Building on previous work, we find that, since the gas first appeared in the atmosphere in the 1960s, global CFC-113a mixing ratios have been increasing monotonically to the present day. Mixing ratios of CFC-113a have increased by 40\\u202f% from 0.50 to 0.70\\u202fppt in the Southern Hemisphere between the end of the previously published record in December 2012 and February 2017. We derive updated global emissions of 1.7\\u202fGg\\u202fyr−1 on average between 2012 and 2016 using a two-dimensional model. We compare the long-term trends and emissions of CFC-113a to those of its structural isomer, CFC-113 (CClF2CCl2F), which still has much higher mixing ratios than CFC-113a, despite its mixing ratios and emissions decreasing since the 1990s. The continued presence of northern hemispheric emissions of CFC-113a is confirmed by our measurements of a persistent interhemispheric gradient in its mixing ratios, with higher mixing ratios in the Northern Hemisphere. The sources of CFC-113a are still unclear, but we present evidence that indicates large emissions in East Asia, most likely due to its use as a chemical involved in the production of hydrofluorocarbons. Our aircraft data confirm the interhemispheric gradient as well as showing mixing ratios consistent with ground-based observations and the relatively long atmospheric lifetime of CFC-113a. CFC-113a is the only known CFC for which abundances are still increasing substantially in the atmosphere. Aerosol midlatitude cyclone indirect effects in observations and high-resolution simulations Aerosol–cloud interactions are a major source of uncertainty in inferring the climate sensitivity from the observational record of temperature. The adjustment of clouds to aerosol is a poorly constrained aspect of these aerosol–cloud interactions. Here, we examine the response of midlatitude cyclone cloud properties to a change in cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). Idealized experiments in high-resolution, convection-permitting global aquaplanet simulations with constant CDNC are compared to 13 years of remote-sensing observations. Observations and idealized aquaplanet simulations agree that increased warm conveyor belt (WCB) moisture flux into cyclones is consistent with higher cyclone liquid water path (CLWP). When CDNC is increased a larger LWP is needed to give the same rain rate. The LWP adjusts to allow the rain rate to be equal to the moisture flux into the cyclone along the WCB. This results in an increased CLWP for higher CDNC at a fixed WCB moisture flux in both observations and simulations. If observed cyclones in the top and bottom tercile of CDNC are contrasted it is found that they have not only higher CLWP but also cloud cover and albedo. The difference in cyclone albedo between the cyclones in the top and bottom third of CDNC is observed by CERES to be between 0.018 and 0.032, which is consistent with a 4.6–8.3\\u2009Wm−2 in-cyclone enhancement in upwelling shortwave when scaled by annual-mean insolation. Based on a regression model to observed cyclone properties, roughly 60\\u2009% of the observed variability in CLWP can be explained by CDNC and WCB moisture flux. Retrieval of ice-nucleating particle concentrations from lidar observations and comparison with UAV in situ measurements Abstract. Aerosols that are efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are crucial for the formation of cloud ice via heterogeneous nucleation in the atmosphere. The distribution of INPs on a large spatial scale and as a function of height determines their impact on clouds and climate. However, in situ measurements of INPs provide sparse coverage over space and time. A promising approach to address this gap is to retrieve INP concentration profiles by combining particle concentration profiles derived by lidar measurements with INP efficiency parameterizations for different freezing mechanisms (immersion freezing, deposition nucleation). Here, we assess the feasibility of this new method for both ground-based and spaceborne lidar measurements, using in situ observations collected with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and subsequently analyzed with the FRIDGE (FRankfurt Ice nucleation Deposition freezinG Experiment) INP counter from an experimental campaign at Cyprus in April 2016. Analyzing five case studies we calculated the cloud-relevant particle number concentrations using lidar measurements (n250,dry with an uncertainty of 20\\u2009% to 40\\u2009% and Sdry with an uncertainty of 30\\u2009% to 50\\u2009%), and we assessed the suitability of the different INP parameterizations with respect to the temperature range and the type of particles considered. Specifically, our analysis suggests that our calculations using the parameterization of Ullrich et al. (2017) (applicable for the temperature range −50 to −33\\u2009∘C) agree within 1\\xa0order of magnitude with the in situ observations of nINP; thus, the parameterization of Ullrich et al. (2017) can efficiently address the deposition nucleation pathway in dust-dominated environments. Additionally, our calculations using the combination of the parameterizations of DeMott et al. (2015, 2010) (applicable for the temperature range −35 to −9\\u2009∘C) agree within 2\\xa0orders of magnitude with the in situ observations of INP concentrations (nINP) and can thus efficiently address the immersion/condensation pathway of dust and nondust particles. The same conclusion is derived from the compilation of the parameterizations of DeMott et al. (2015) for dust and Ullrich et al. (2017) for soot. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to estimate the INP concentration profiles before and after a cloud formation, indicating the seeding role of the particles and their subsequent impact on cloud formation and characteristics. More synergistic datasets are expected to become available in the future from EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) and in the frame of the European ACTRIS-RI (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research Infrastructure). Our analysis shows that the developed techniques, when applied on CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) spaceborne lidar observations, are in agreement with the in situ measurements. This study gives us confidence for the production of global 3-D products of cloud-relevant particle number concentrations (n250,dry, Sdry and nINP) using the CALIPSO 13-year dataset. This could provide valuable insight into the global height-resolved distribution of INP concentrations related to mineral dust, as well as possibly other aerosol types. Effects of aerosol in simulations of realistic shallow cumulus cloud fields in a large domain Abstract. Previous study of shallow convection has generally suffered from having to balance domain size with resolution, resulting in high-resolution studies which do not capture large-scale behaviour of the cloud fields. In this work we hope to go some way towards addressing this by carrying out cloud-resolving simulations on large domains. Simulations of trade wind cumulus are carried out using the Met Office Unified Model (UM), based on a case study from the Rain In Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) field campaign. The UM is run with a nested domain of 500\\u2009km with 500\\u2009m resolution, in order to capture the large-scale behaviour of the cloud field, and with a double-moment interactive microphysics scheme. Simulations are run using baseline aerosol profiles based on observations from RICO, which are then perturbed. We find that the aerosol perturbations result in changes to the convective behaviour of the cloud field, with higher aerosol leading to an increase (decrease) in the number of deeper (shallower) clouds. However, despite this deepening, there is little increase in the frequency of higher rain rates. This is in contrast to the findings of previous work making use of idealised simulation setups. In further contrast, we find that increasing aerosol results in a persistent increase in domain mean liquid water path and decrease in precipitation, with little impact on cloud fraction. Aerosol effects on deep convection: the propagation of aerosol perturbations through  convective cloud microphysics Abstract. The impact of aerosols on ice- and mixed-phase processes in deep convective clouds remains highly uncertain, and the wide range of interacting microphysical processes is still poorly understood. To understand these processes, we analyse diagnostic output of all individual microphysical process rates for two bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather and Research Forecasting model (WRF). We investigate the response of individual processes to changes in aerosol conditions and the propagation of perturbations through the microphysics all the way to the macrophysical development of the convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. convective clouds. We perform simulations for two different cases of idealised supercells using two double-moment bulk microphysics schemes and a bin microphysics scheme. The simulations cover a comprehensive range of values for cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration as a proxy for aerosol effects on We have developed a new cloud tracking algorithm to analyse the morphology and time evolution of individually tracked convective cells in the simulations and their response to the aerosol perturbations. This analysis confirms an expected decrease in warm rain formation processes due to autoconversion and accretion for more polluted conditions. There is no evidence of a significant increase in the total amount of latent heat, as changes to the individual components of the integrated latent heating in the cloud compensate each other. The latent heating from freezing and riming processes is shifted to a higher altitude in the cloud, but there is no significant change to the integrated latent heat from freezing. Different choices in the treatment of deposition and sublimation processes between the microphysics schemes lead to strong differences including feedbacks onto condensation and evaporation. These changes in the microphysical processes explain some of the response in cloud mass and the altitude of the cloud centre of gravity. However, there remain some contrasts in the development of the bulk cloud parameters between the microphysics schemes and the two simulated cases. Constraining the aerosol influence on cloud liquid water path Abstract. The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate. Significant progress has been made in constraining this forcing using observations, but uncertainty remains, particularly in the magnitude of cloud rapid adjustments to aerosol perturbations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is the leading control on liquid-cloud albedo, making it important to observationally constrain the aerosol impact on LWP. Previous modelling and observational studies have shown that multiple processes play a role in determining the LWP response to aerosol perturbations, but that the aerosol effect can be difficult to isolate. Following previous studies using mediating variables, this work investigates use of the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and LWP for constraining the role of aerosols. Using joint-probability histograms to account for the non-linear relationship, this work finds a relationship that is broadly consistent with previous studies. There is significant geographical variation in the relationship, partly due to role of meteorological factors (particularly relative humidity). The Nd–LWP relationship is negative in the majority of regions, suggesting that aerosol-induced LWP reductions could offset a significant fraction of the instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions (RFaci). However, variations in the Nd–LWP relationship in response to volcanic and shipping aerosol perturbations indicate that the Nd–LWP relationship overestimates the causal Nd impact on LWP due to the role of confounding factors. The weaker LWP reduction implied by these “natural experiments” means that this work provides an upper bound to the radiative forcing from aerosol-induced changes in the LWP. Evaluation of global simulations of aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei number, with  implications for cloud droplet formation Abstract. A total of 16\\xa0global chemistry transport models and general circulation models have participated in this study; 14\\xa0models have been evaluated with regard to their ability to reproduce the near-surface observed number concentration of aerosol particles and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), as well as derived cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). Model results for the period 2011–2015 are compared with aerosol measurements (aerosol particle number, CCN and aerosol particle composition in the submicron fraction) from nine surface stations located in Europe and Japan. The evaluation focuses on the ability of models to simulate the average across time state in diverse environments and on the seasonal and short-term variability in the aerosol properties. There is no single model that systematically performs best across all environments represented by the observations. Models tend to underestimate the observed aerosol particle and CCN number concentrations, with average normalized mean bias (NMB) of all models and for all stations, where data are available, of −24\\u2009% and −35\\u2009% for particles with dry diameters >50 and >120\\u2009nm, as well as −36\\u2009% and −34\\u2009% for CCN at supersaturations of 0.2\\u2009% and 1.0\\u2009%, respectively. However, they seem to behave differently for particles activating at very low supersaturations (<0.1\\u2009%) than at higher ones. A total of 15\\xa0models have been used to produce ensemble annual median distributions of relevant parameters. The model diversity (defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean) is up to about 3 for simulated N3 (number concentration of particles with dry diameters larger than 3\\u2009nm) and up to about 1 for simulated CCN in the extra-polar regions. A global mean reduction of a factor of about 2 is found in the model diversity for CCN at a supersaturation of 0.2\\u2009% (CCN0.2) compared to that for N3, maximizing over regions where new particle formation is important. An additional model has been used to investigate potential causes of model diversity in CCN and bias compared to the observations by performing a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) accounting for uncertainties in 26 aerosol-related model input parameters. This PPE suggests that biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation and the hygroscopic properties of the organic material are likely to be the major sources of CCN uncertainty in summer, with dry deposition and cloud processing being dominant in winter. Models capture the relative amplitude of the seasonal variability of the aerosol particle number concentration for all studied particle sizes with available observations (dry diameters larger than 50, 80 and 120\\u2009nm). The short-term persistence time (on the order of a few days) of CCN concentrations, which is a measure of aerosol dynamic behavior in the models, is underestimated on average by the models by 40\\u2009% during winter and 20\\u2009% in summer. In contrast to the large spread in simulated aerosol particle and CCN number concentrations, the CDNC derived from simulated CCN spectra is less diverse and in better agreement with CDNC estimates consistently derived from the observations (average NMB −13\\u2009% and −22\\u2009% for updraft velocities 0.3 and 0.6\\u2009m\\u2009s−1, respectively). In addition, simulated CDNC is in slightly better agreement with observationally derived values at lower than at higher updraft velocities (index of agreement 0.64 vs.\\xa00.65). The reduced spread of CDNC compared to that of CCN is attributed to the sublinear response of CDNC to aerosol particle number variations and the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol particle number concentration (∂Nd/∂Na) and to updraft velocity (∂Nd/∂w). Overall, we find that while CCN is controlled by both aerosol particle number and composition, CDNC is sensitive to CCN at low and moderate CCN concentrations and to the updraft velocity when CCN levels are high. Discrepancies are found in sensitivities ∂Nd/∂Na and ∂Nd/∂w; models may be predisposed to be too “aerosol sensitive” or “aerosol insensitive” in aerosol–cloud–climate interaction studies, even if they may capture average droplet numbers well. This is a subtle but profound finding that only the sensitivities can clearly reveal and may explain inter-model biases on the aerosol indirect effect. Untangling causality in midlatitude aerosol–cloud adjustments Aerosol–cloud interactions represent the leading uncertainty in our ability to infer climate sensitivity from the observational record. The forcing from changes in cloud albedo driven by increases in cloud droplet number (Nd) (the first indirect effect) is confidently negative and has narrowed its probable range in the last decade, but the sign and strength of forcing associated with changes in cloud macrophysics in response to aerosol (aerosol–cloud adjustments) remain uncertain. This uncertainty reflects our inability to accurately quantify variability not associated with a causal link flowing from the cloud microphysical state to the cloud macrophysical state. Once variability associated with meteorology has been removed, covariance between the liquid water path (LWP) averaged across cloudy and clear regions (here characterizing the macrophysical state) and Nd (characterizing the microphysical) is the sum of two causal pathways linking Nd to LWP: Nd altering LWP (adjustments) and precipitation scavenging aerosol and thus depleting Nd. Only the former term is relevant to constraining adjustments, but disentangling these terms in observations is challenging. We hypothesize that the diversity of constraints on aerosol–cloud adjustments in the literature may be partly due to not explicitly characterizing covariance flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. Here, we restrict our analysis to the regime of extratropical clouds outside of low-pressure centers associated with cyclonic activity. Observations from MAC-LWP (Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path) and MODIS are compared to simulations in the Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1). The meteorological predictors of LWP are found to be similar between the model and observations. There is also agreement with previous literature on cloud-controlling factors finding that increasing stability, moisture, and sensible heat flux enhance LWP, while increasing subsidence and sea surface temperature decrease it. A simulation where cloud microphysics are insensitive to changes in Nd is used to characterize covariance between Nd and LWP that is induced by factors other than aerosol–cloud adjustments. By removing variability associated with meteorology and scavenging, we infer the sensitivity of LWP to changes in Nd. Application of this technique to UM GA7.1 simulations reproduces the true model adjustment strength. Observational constraints developed using simulated covariability not induced by adjustments and observed covariability between Nd and LWP predict a 25\\u2009%–30\\u2009% overestimate by the UM GA7.1 in LWP change and a 30\\u2009%–35\\u2009% overestimate in associated radiative forcing. Surprising similarities in model and observational aerosol radiative forcing estimates Abstract. The radiative forcing from aerosols (particularly through their interaction with clouds) remains one of the most uncertain components of the human forcing of the climate. Observation-based studies have typically found a smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model simulations and were given preferential weighting in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty in the impact of aerosols on the climate. These reported discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating the components of aerosol forcing used in model and observational studies. Applying the observational decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on cloud properties. Cloud adjustments remain a significant source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However, they are consistent with the uncertainty from observation-based methods, with the liquid water path adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50\\u2009%. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be more equally weighted in future synthesis studies. Ensemble daily simulations for elucidating cloud–aerosol interactions under a large spread of realistic environmental conditions Abstract. Aerosol effects on cloud properties and the atmospheric energy and radiation budgets are studied through ensemble simulations over two month-long periods during the NARVAL campaigns (Next-generation Aircraft Remote-Sensing for Validation Studies, December\\xa02013 and August\\xa02016). For each day, two simulations are conducted with low and high cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs), representing low and high aerosol concentrations, respectively. This large data set, which is based on a large spread of co-varying realistic initial conditions, enables robust identification of the effect of CDNC changes on cloud properties. We show that increases in CDNC drive a reduction in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net shortwave flux (more reflection) and a decrease in the lower-tropospheric stability for all cases examined, while the TOA longwave flux and the liquid and ice water path changes are generally positive. However, changes in cloud fraction or precipitation, that could appear significant for a given day, are not as robustly affected, and, at least for the summer month, are not statistically distinguishable from zero. These results highlight the need for using a large sample of initial conditions for cloud–aerosol studies for identifying the significance of the response. In addition, we demonstrate the dependence of the aerosol effects on the season, as it is shown that the TOA net radiative effect is doubled during the winter month as compared to the summer month. By separating the simulations into different dominant cloud regimes, we show that the difference between the different months emerges due to the compensation of the longwave effect induced by an increase in ice content as compared to the shortwave effect of the liquid clouds. The CDNC effect on the longwave flux is stronger in the summer as the clouds are deeper and the atmosphere is more unstable. Role of climate model dynamics in estimated climate responses to anthropogenic aerosols &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Significant discrepancies remain in estimates of climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosols between different general circulation models (GCMs). Here, we demonstrate that eliminating differences in model aerosol or radiative forcing fields results in close agreement in simulated globally averaged temperature and precipitation responses in the studied GCMs. However, it does not erase the differences in regional responses. We carry out experiments of equilibrium climate response to modern day anthropogenic aerosols using an identical representation of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and aerosol-cloud interactions, MACv2-SP, in two independent climate models (NorESM and ECHAM6). We find consistent global average temperature responses of &amp;#8722;0.48&amp;#8201;K and &amp;#8722;0.50&amp;#8201;K and precipitation responses of &amp;#8722;1.69&amp;#8201;% and &amp;#8722;1.79&amp;#8201;% in NorESM1 and ECHAM6, respectively, compared to modern-day equilibrium climate without anthropogenic aerosols. However, significant differences remain between the two GCMs regional temperature responses around the Arctic circle and the equator and precipitation responses in the tropics. The scatter in the simulated globally averaged responses is small in magnitude when compared against literature data from modern GCMs using model intrinsic aerosols but same aerosol emissions (&amp;#8722;(0.5&amp;#8211;1.1)&amp;#8201;K and &amp;#8722;(1.5&amp;#8211;3.1)&amp;#8201;% for temperature and precipitation, respectively). The Pearson correlation of regional temperature (precipitation) response in these literature model experiments with intrinsic aerosols is 0.79 (0.34). The corresponding correlation coefficients for NorESM1 and ECHAM6 runs with identical aerosols are 0.78 (0.41). The lack of improvement in correlation coefficients between models with identical aerosols and models with intrinsic aerosols implies that the spatial distribution of regional climate responses is not improved via homogenizing the aerosol descriptions in the models. Rather, differences in the atmospheric dynamic and high latitude cloud and snow/sea ice cover responses dominate the differences in regional climate responses. Hence, further improvements in the model aerosol descriptions can be expected to have a limited value in improving our understanding of regional aerosol climate impacts, unless the dynamical cores of the climate models are improved as well.&lt;/p&gt; Surprising similarities in model and observational aerosol radiative forcing estimates &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; The radiative forcing from aerosols (particularly through their interaction with clouds) remains one of the most uncertain components of the human forcing of the climate.

A polarization lidar allows for the identification of irregular-shaped particles such as volcanic dust and desert dust. The Single Calculus Chain (SCC) of the European Aerosol Lidar Network (EARLINET) delivers high resolution pre-processed data: the calibrated total attenuated backscatter and the calibrated volume linear depolarization ratio time series. From these calibrated lidar signals, the particle backscatter coefficient and the particle depolarization ratio can be derived in temporally-high resolution, and thus provide the basis of the NRT Early Warning System (EWS). In particular, an iterative method for the retrieval of the particle backscatter is implemented. This improved capability was designed as a pilot that will produce alerts for imminent threats for aviation. The method is applied to data during two diverse aerosol scenarios: first, a record breaking desert dust intrusion in March 2018 over Finokalia, Greece, and, second, an intrusion of volcanic particles originating from Mount Etna in June 2019 over Antikythera, Greece. Additionally, a devoted observational period including several EARLINET lidar systems demonstrates the network\\'s preparedness to offer insight into natural hazards that affect the aviation sector.&lt;/p&gt; GARRLiC and LIRIC: strengths and limitations for the characterization of dust and marine particles along with their mixtures Abstract. The Generalized Aerosol Retrieval from Radiometer and Lidar Combined data algorithm (GARRLiC) and the LIdar-Radiometer Inversion Code (LIRIC) provide the opportunity to study the aerosol vertical distribution by combining ground-based lidar and sun-photometric measurements. Here, we utilize the capabilities of both algorithms for the characterization of Saharan dust and marine particles, along with their mixtures, in the south-eastern Mediterranean during the CHARacterization of Aerosol mixtures of Dust and Marine origin Experiment (CHARADMExp). Three case studies are presented, focusing on dust-dominated, marine-dominated and dust–marine mixing conditions. GARRLiC and LIRIC achieve a satisfactory characterization for the dust-dominated case in terms of particle microphysical properties and concentration profiles. The marine-dominated and the mixture cases are more challenging for both algorithms, although GARRLiC manages to provide more detailed microphysical retrievals compared to AERONET, while LIRIC effectively discriminates dust and marine particles in its concentration profile retrievals. The results are also compared with modelled dust and marine concentration profiles and surface in situ measurements. On-flight intercomparison of three miniature aerosol absorption sensors using unmanned aerial systems (UASs) Abstract. The present study investigates and compares the ground and in-flight performance of three miniaturized aerosol absorption sensors integrated on board small-sized Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs). These sensors were evaluated during two contrasted field campaigns performed at an urban site, impacted mainly by local traffic and domestic wood burning sources (Athens, Greece), and at a remote regional background site, impacted by long-range transported sources including dust (Cyprus Atmospheric Observatory, Agia Marina Xyliatou, Cyprus). The miniaturized sensors were first intercompared at the ground-level against two commercially available instruments used as a reference. The measured signal of the miniaturized sensors was converted into the absorption coefficient and equivalent black carbon concentration (eBC). When applicable, signal saturation corrections were applied, following the suggestions of the manufacturers. The aerosol absorption sensors exhibited similar behavior against the reference instruments during the two campaigns, despite the diversity of the aerosol origin, chemical composition, sources, and concentration levels. The deviation from the reference during both campaigns concerning (eBC) mass was less than 8\\u2009%, while for the absorption coefficient it was at least 15\\u2009%. This indicates that those sensors that report black carbon mass are tuned and corrected to measure eBC more accurately than the absorption coefficient. The overall potential use of miniature aerosol absorption sensors on board small UASs is also illustrated. UAS-based absorption measurements were used to investigate the vertical distribution of eBC over Athens up to 1\\u2009km above sea level during January\\xa02016, exceeding the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Our results reveal a heterogeneous boundary layer concentration of absorbing aerosol within the PBL intensified in the early morning hours due to the concurrent peak traffic emissions at ground-level and the fast development of the boundary layer. After the full development of the PBL, homogenous concentrations are observed from 100\\u2009m\\u2009a.g.l. to the PBL top. The potential of elastic and polarization lidars to retrieve extinction profiles Abstract. A new method, called ElEx (elastic extinction), is proposed for the estimation of extinction coefficient lidar profiles using only the information provided by the elastic and polarization channels of a lidar system. The method is applicable to lidar measurements both during daytime and nighttime under well-defined aerosol mixtures. ElEx uses the particle backscatter profiles at 532\\u2009nm and the vertically resolved particle linear depolarization ratio measurements at the same wavelength. The particle linear depolarization ratio and the lidar ratio values of pure aerosol types are also taken from literature. The total extinction profile is then estimated and compared well with Raman retrievals. In this study, ElEx was applied in an aerosol mixture of marine and dust particles at Finokalia station during the CHARADMExp campaign. Any difference between ElEx and Raman extinction profiles indicates that the nondust component could be probably attributed to polluted marine or polluted continental aerosols. Comparison with sun photometer aerosol optical depth observations is performed as well during daytime. Differences in the total aerosol optical depth are varying between 1.2\\u2009% and 72\\u2009%, and these differences are attributed to the limited ability of the lidar to correctly represent the aerosol optical properties in the near range due to the overlap problem. Uncertainty in the global oceanic CO2 uptake induced by wind forcing: quantification and spatial analysis Abstract. The calculation of the air–water CO2 exchange (FCO2) in the ocean not only depends on the gradient in CO2 partial pressure at the air–water interface but also on the parameterization of the gas exchange transfer velocity (k) and the choice of wind product. Here, we present regional and global-scale quantifications of the uncertainty in FCO2 induced by several widely used k\\xa0formulations and four wind speed data products (CCMP, ERA, NCEP1 and NCEP2). The analysis is performed at a 1°\\u202f\\u2009×\\u2009\\u202f1° resolution using the sea surface pCO2 climatology generated by Landschützer et al.\\xa0(2015a) for the 1991–2011 period, while the regional assessment relies on the segmentation proposed by the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP) project. First, we use k\\xa0formulations derived from the global 14C inventory relying on a quadratic relationship between k and wind speed (k\\u2009=\\u2009c\\u2009⋅\\u2009U102; Sweeney et al., 2007; Takahashi et al., 2009; Wanninkhof, 2014), where c is a calibration coefficient and U10 is the wind speed measured 10\\u202fm above the surface. Our results show that the range of global FCO2, calculated with these k\\xa0relationships, diverge by 12\\u202f% when using CCMP, ERA or NCEP1. Due to differences in the regional wind patterns, regional discrepancies in FCO2 are more pronounced than global. These global and regional differences significantly increase when using NCEP2 or other k\\xa0formulations which include earlier relationships (i.e., Wanninkhof, 1992; Wanninkhof et al., 2009) as well as numerous local and regional parameterizations derived experimentally. To minimize uncertainties associated with the choice of wind product, it is possible to recalculate the coefficient c globally (hereafter called c∗) for a given wind product and its spatio-temporal resolution, in order to match the last evaluation of the global k value. We thus performed these recalculations for each wind product at the resolution and time period of our study but the resulting global FCO2 estimates still diverge by 10\\u202f%. These results also reveal that the Equatorial Pacific, the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean are the regions in which the choice of wind product will most strongly affect the estimation of the FCO2, even when using c∗. Rapid mineralization of biogenic volatile organic compounds in temperate and Arctic soils Abstract. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are produced by all life forms. Their release into the atmosphere is important with regards to a number of climate-related physical and chemical processes and great effort has been put into determining sources and sinks of these compounds in recent years. Soil microbes have been suggested as a possible sink for BVOCs in the atmosphere; however, experimental evidence for this sink is scarce despite its potentially high importance to both carbon cycling and atmospheric concentrations of these gases. We therefore conducted a study with a number of commonly occurring BVOCs labelled with 14C and modified existing methods to study the mineralization of these compounds to 14CO2 in four different topsoils. Five of the six BVOCs were rapidly mineralized by microbes in all soils. However, great differences were observed with regards to the speed of mineralization, extent of mineralization and variation between soil types. Methanol, benzaldehyde, acetophenone and the oxygenated monoterpene geraniol were mineralized within hours in all soils. The hydrocarbon monoterpene p-cymene was mineralized rapidly in soil from a coniferous forest but was mineralized slower in soil from an adjacent beech stand, while chloroform was mineralized slowly in all soils. From our study it is clear that soil microbes are able to completely degrade BVOCs released by above-ground vegetation as well as BVOCs released by soil microbes and plant roots. In addition to the possible atmospheric implications of this degradation, the very fast mineralization rates are likely important in shaping the net BVOC emissions from soil and it is possible that BVOC formation and degradation may be important but little-recognized parts of internal carbon cycling in soil. Scaling carbon fluxes from eddy covariance sites to globe: synthesis and evaluation of the FLUXCOM approach Abstract. FLUXNET comprises globally distributed eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere–atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed. Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles (R2>0.94 at 1∘ spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70\\u2009% of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008–2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130\\u2009PgC\\u2009yr−1 with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R2∼0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise R2∼0.6). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R2>0.92). Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (R2=0.87 for 2001–2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for CO2 fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall. Carbon–concentration and carbon–climate feedbacks in CMIP6 models and their comparison to CMIP5 models Abstract. Results from the fully and biogeochemically coupled simulations in which CO2 increases at a rate of 1\\u2009%\\u2009yr−1 (1pctCO2) from its preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of carbon–concentration and carbon–climate feedback parameters which measure the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate, respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The strength of the carbon–concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes over land (mean\\u2009±\\u2009standard deviation\\u2009=\\u20090.97\\u2009±\\u20090.40\\u2009PgC\\u2009ppm−1) and ocean (0.79\\u2009±\\u20090.07\\u2009PgC\\u2009ppm−1), while the carbon–climate feedback over land (−45.1\\u2009±\\u200950.6\\u2009PgC\\u2009∘C−1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (−17.2\\u2009±\\u20095.0\\u2009PgC\\u2009∘C−1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is 1.77\\u2009±\\u20090.37\\u2009∘C\\u2009EgC−1 and is similar to that found in CMIP5 models (1.63\\u2009±\\u20090.48\\u2009∘C\\u2009EgC−1) but with somewhat reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation are simplified when the small temperature change in the biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon cycle models. Early instrumental meteorological measurements in Switzerland Abstract. The decadal variability of weather and its extremes are still poorly understood. This is partly due to the scarcity of records, which, for many parts of the world, only allow for studies of 20th century weather. However, the 18th and early 19th centuries saw some pronounced climatic variations, with equally pronounced impacts on the environment and society. Considerable amounts of weather data are available even for that time but have not yet been digitised. Given recent progress in the quantitative reconstruction of subdaily weather, such data could form the basis of weather reconstructions. In Switzerland, measurements before 1864 (the start of the national network) have never been systematically compiled except for three prominent series (Geneva, Basel, Great St. Bernard Pass). Here we provide an overview of early instrumental meteorological measurements in Switzerland resulting from an archive survey. Our inventory encompasses 334 entries from 206 locations, providing an estimated 3640 station years and reaching back to the early 18th century. Most of the data sheets have been photographed and a considerable fraction is undergoing digitisation. This paper accompanies the online publication of the imaged data series and metadata. We provide a detailed inventory of the series, discuss their historical context, and provide the photographed data sheets. We demonstrate their usefulness on behalf of two historical cases and show how they complement the existing series in Europe. If similar searches in other countries yield similarly rich results, an extension of daily weather reconstructions for Europe back to the 1760s is possible. Partitioning climate projection uncertainty  with multiple large ensembles and CMIP5/6 Abstract. Partitioning uncertainty in projections of future climate change into contributions from internal variability, model response uncertainty and emissions scenarios has historically relied on making assumptions about forced changes in the mean and variability. With the advent of multiple single-model initial-condition large ensembles\\xa0(SMILEs), these assumptions can be scrutinized, as they allow a more robust separation between sources of uncertainty. Here, the framework from Hawkins and Sutton\\xa0(2009) for uncertainty partitioning is revisited for temperature and precipitation projections using seven SMILEs and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives. The original approach is shown to work well at global scales (potential method bias\\u2009<\\u200920\\u2009%), while at local to regional scales such as British Isles temperature or Sahel precipitation, there is a notable potential method bias (up to 50\\u2009%), and more accurate partitioning of uncertainty is achieved through the use of SMILEs. Whenever internal variability and forced changes therein are important, the need to evaluate and improve the representation of variability in models is evident. The available SMILEs are shown to be a good representation of the CMIP5 model diversity in many situations, making them a useful tool for interpreting CMIP5. CMIP6 often shows larger absolute and relative model uncertainty than CMIP5, although part of this difference can be reconciled with the higher average transient climate response in CMIP6. This study demonstrates the added value of a collection of SMILEs for quantifying and diagnosing uncertainty in climate projections. Recent changes of relative humidity: regional connections with land and ocean processes Abstract. We analyzed changes in surface relative humidity (RH) at the global scale from 1979 to 2014 using both observations and the ERA-Interim dataset. We compared the variability and trends in RH with those of land evapotranspiration and ocean evaporation in moisture source areas across a range of selected regions worldwide. The sources of moisture for each particular region were identified by integrating different observational data and model outputs into a Lagrangian approach. The aim was to account for the possible role of changes in air temperature over land, in comparison to sea surface temperature (SST), but also the role of land evapotranspiration and the ocean evaporation on RH variability. The results demonstrate that the patterns of the observed trends in RH at the global scale cannot be linked to a particular\\xa0individual physical mechanism. Our results also stress that the different hypotheses that may explain the decrease in RH under a global warming scenario could act together to explain recent RH trends. Albeit with uncertainty in establishing a direct causality between RH trends and the different empirical moisture sources, we found that the observed decrease in RH in some regions can be linked to lower water supply from land evapotranspiration. In contrast, the empirical relationships also suggest that RH trends in other target regions are mainly explained by the dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms related to the moisture supply from the oceanic source regions. Overall, while this work gives insights into the connections between RH trends and oceanic and continental processes at the global scale, further investigation is still desired to assess the contribution of both dynamic and thermodynamic factors to the evolution of RH over continental regions. Global Carbon Budget 2018 Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use and land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the last decade available (2008–2017), EFF was 9.4±0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, ELUC 1.5±0.7\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, GATM 4.7±0.02\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, SOCEAN 2.4±0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, and SLAND 3.2±0.8\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2017 alone, the growth in EFF was about 1.6\\u2009% and emissions increased to 9.9±0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1. Also for 2017, ELUC was 1.4±0.7\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, GATM was 4.6±0.2\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, SOCEAN was 2.5±0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, and SLAND was 3.8±0.8\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3\\u2009GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 405.0±0.1\\u2009ppm averaged over 2017. For 2018, preliminary data for the first 6–9\\xa0months indicate a renewed growth in EFF of +2.7\\u2009% (range of 1.8\\u2009% to 3.7\\u2009%) based on national emission projections for China, the US, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. The analysis presented here shows that the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period of 1959–2017, but discrepancies of up to 1\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations show (1)\\xa0no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions, (2)\\xa0a persistent low agreement among the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3)\\xa0an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models, originating outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

Nearshore slope, defined as the cross-shore gradient of the subaqueous profile, is an important input parameter which affects hydrodynamic and morphological coastal processes. It is used in both local and large-scale coastal investigations. However, due to unavailability of data, most studies, especially those that focus on continental or global scales, have historically adopted a uniform nearshore slope. This simplifying assumption could however have far-reaching implications for predictions/projections thus obtained. Here, we present the first global dataset of nearshore slopes with a resolution of 1\\u2009km at almost 620\\u2009000 points along the global coastline. To this end, coastal profiles were constructed using global topo-bathymetric datasets. The results show that the nearshore slopes vary substantially around the world. An assessment of coastline recession driven by sea level rise (SLR) (for an arbitrary 0.5\\u2009m SLR) with a globally uniform coastal slope of 1\\u2009:\\u2009100, as carried out in previous studies, and with the spatially variable coastal slopes computed herein shows that, on average, the former approach would underestimate coastline recession by about 40\\u2009%, albeit with significant spatial variation. The final dataset has been made publicly available at https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:a8297dcd-c34e-4e6d-bf66-9fb8913d983d (Athanasiou, 2019). Global Carbon Budget 2019 Abstract.

For the year 2018 alone, the growth in EFF was about 2.1\\u2009% and fossil emissions increased to 10.0±0.5\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, reaching 10\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 for the first time in history, ELUC was 1.5±0.7\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5±0.9\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 (42.5±3.3\\u2009GtCO2). Also for 2018, GATM was 5.1±0.2\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 (2.4±0.1\\u2009ppm\\u2009yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.6±0.6\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5±0.7\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3\\u2009GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 407.38±0.1\\u2009ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the first 6–10\\xa0months indicate a reduced growth in EFF of +0.6\\u2009% (range of −0.2\\u2009% to 1.5\\u2009%) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2018, but discrepancies of up to 1\\u2009GtC\\u2009yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013). The data generated by this work are available at https://doi.org/10.18160/gcp-2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). The Global Methane Budget 2000–2017 Abstract. Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al.\\xa0(2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008–2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 (range 550–594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this total, 359\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 or ∼\\u200960\\u2009% is attributed to anthropogenic sources, that is emissions caused by direct human activity (i.e. anthropogenic emissions; range 336–376\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 or 50\\u2009%–65\\u2009%). The mean annual total emission for the new decade (2008–2017) is 29\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 larger than our estimate for the previous decade (2000–2009), and 24\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 larger than the one reported in the previous budget for 2003–2012 (Saunois et al., 2016). Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30\\u2009% larger global emissions (737\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1, range 594–881) than top-down inversion methods. Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (∼\\u200965\\u2009% of the global budget, <\\u200930∘\\u2009N) compared to mid-latitudes (∼\\u200930\\u2009%, 30–60∘\\u2009N) and high northern latitudes (∼\\u20094\\u2009%, 60–90∘\\u2009N). The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters. Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013). In particular wetland emissions are about 35\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 lower due to improved partition wetlands and other inland waters. Emissions from geological sources and wild animals are also found to be smaller by 7\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1 by 8\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4\\u2009yr−1, respectively. However, the overall discrepancy between bottom-up and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5\\u2009% compared to Saunois et al.\\xa0(2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors. Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i)\\xa0a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii)\\xa0further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii)\\xa0intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-CH4 measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv)\\xa0improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v)\\xa0development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.

UCLALES–SALSA v1.0: a large-eddy model with interactive sectional microphysics for aerosol, clouds and precipitation Abstract. Challenges in understanding the aerosol–cloud interactions and their impacts on global climate highlight the need for improved knowledge of the underlying physical processes and feedbacks as well as their interactions with cloud and boundary layer dynamics. To pursue this goal, increasingly sophisticated cloud-scale models are needed to complement the limited supply of observations of the interactions between aerosols and clouds. For this purpose, a new large-eddy simulation (LES) model, coupled with an interactive sectional description for aerosols and clouds, is introduced. The new model builds and extends upon the well-characterized UCLA Large-Eddy Simulation Code (UCLALES) and the Sectional Aerosol module for Large-Scale Applications (SALSA), hereafter denoted as UCLALES-SALSA. Novel strategies for the aerosol, cloud and precipitation bin discretisation are presented. These enable tracking the effects of cloud processing and wet scavenging on the aerosol size distribution as accurately as possible, while keeping the computational cost of the model as low as possible. The model is tested with two different simulation set-ups: a marine stratocumulus case in the DYCOMS-II campaign and another case focusing on the formation and evolution of a nocturnal radiation fog. It is shown that, in both cases, the size-resolved interactions between aerosols and clouds have a critical influence on the dynamics of the boundary layer. The results demonstrate the importance of accurately representing the wet scavenging of aerosol in the model. Specifically, in a case with marine stratocumulus, precipitation and the subsequent removal of cloud activating particles lead to thinning of the cloud deck and the formation of a decoupled boundary layer structure. In radiation fog, the growth and sedimentation of droplets strongly affect their radiative properties, which in turn drive new droplet formation. The size-resolved diagnostics provided by the model enable investigations of these issues with high detail. It is also shown that the results remain consistent with UCLALES (without SALSA) in cases where the dominating physical processes remain well represented by both models. The regional climate model REMO (v2015) coupled with the 1-D freshwater lake model FLake (v1): Fenno-Scandinavian climate and lakes Abstract. The regional climate model REMO was coupled with the FLake lake model to include an interactive treatment of lakes. Using this new version, the Fenno-Scandinavian climate and lake characteristics were studied in a\\xa0set of 35-year hindcast simulations. Additionally, sensitivity tests related to the parameterization of snow albedo were conducted. Our results show that overall the new model version improves the representation of the Fenno-Scandinavian climate in terms of 2\\u202fm temperature and precipitation, but the downside is that an existing wintertime cold bias in the model is enhanced. The lake surface water temperature, ice depth and ice season length were analyzed in detail for 10 Finnish, 4 Swedish and 2 Russian lakes and 1 Estonian lake. The results show that the model can reproduce these characteristics with reasonably high accuracy. The cold bias during winter causes overestimation of ice layer thickness, for example, at several of the studied lakes, but overall the values from the model are realistic and represent the lake physics well in a\\xa0long-term simulation. We also analyzed the snow depth on ice from 10 Finnish lakes and vertical temperature profiles from 5 Finnish lakes and the model results are realistic. A protocol for the intercomparison of marine fishery and ecosystem models: Fish-MIP v1.0 Abstract. Model intercomparison studies in the climate and Earth sciences communities have been crucial to building credibility and coherence for future projections. They have quantified variability among models, spurred model development, contrasted within- and among-model uncertainty, assessed model fits to historical data, and provided ensemble projections of future change under specified scenarios. Given the speed and magnitude of anthropogenic change in the marine environment and the consequent effects on food security, biodiversity, marine industries, and society, the time is ripe for similar comparisons among models of fisheries and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project protocol version 1.0 (Fish-MIP v1.0), part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which is a cross-sectoral network of climate impact modellers. Given the complexity of the marine ecosystem, this class of models has substantial heterogeneity of purpose, scope, theoretical underpinning, processes considered, parameterizations, resolution (grain size), and spatial extent. This heterogeneity reflects the lack of a unified understanding of the marine ecosystem and implies that the assemblage of all models is more likely to include a greater number of relevant processes than any single model. The current Fish-MIP protocol is designed to allow these heterogeneous models to be forced with common Earth System Model (ESM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) outputs under prescribed scenarios for historic (from the 1950s) and future (to 2100) time periods; it will be adapted to CMIP phase 6 (CMIP6) in future iterations. It also describes a standardized set of outputs for each participating Fish-MIP model to produce. This enables the broad characterization of differences between and uncertainties within models and projections when assessing climate and fisheries impacts on marine ecosystems and the services they provide. The systematic generation, collation, and comparison of results from Fish-MIP will inform an understanding of the range of plausible changes in marine ecosystems and improve our capacity to define and convey the strengths and weaknesses of model-based advice on future states of marine ecosystems and fisheries. Ultimately, Fish-MIP represents a step towards bringing together the marine ecosystem modelling community to produce consistent ensemble medium- and long-term projections of marine ecosystems. Vegetation distribution and terrestrial carbon cycle in a carbon cycle configuration of JULES4.6 with new plant functional types Abstract. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are used for studying historical and future changes to vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle. JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) represents the land surface in the Hadley Centre climate models and in the UK Earth System Model. Recently the number of plant functional types (PFTs) in JULES was expanded from five to nine to better represent functional diversity in global ecosystems. Here we introduce a more mechanistic representation of vegetation dynamics in TRIFFID, the dynamic vegetation component of JULES, which allows for any number of PFTs to compete based solely on their height; therefore, the previous hardwired dominance hierarchy is removed. With the new set of nine PFTs, JULES is able to more accurately reproduce global vegetation distribution compared to the former five PFT version. Improvements include the coverage of trees within tropical and boreal forests and a reduction in shrubs, the latter of which dominated at high latitudes. We show that JULES is able to realistically represent several aspects of the global carbon (C) cycle. The simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) is within the range of observations, but simulated net primary productivity (NPP) is slightly too high. GPP in JULES from 1982 to 2011 is 133\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1, compared to observation-based estimates (over the same time period) between 123\\u2009±\\u20098 and 150–175\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1. NPP from 2000 to 2013 is 72\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1, compared to satellite-derived NPP of 55\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1 over the same period and independent estimates of 56.2\\u2009±\\u200914.3\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1. The The The The The The The The simulated carbon stored in vegetation is 542\\u2009Pg\\u2009C, compared to an observation-based range of 400–600\\u2009Pg\\u2009C. Soil carbon is much lower (1422\\u2009Pg\\u2009C) than estimates from measurements (>\\u20092400\\u2009Pg\\u2009C), with large underestimations of soil carbon in the tropical and boreal forests. We also examined some aspects of the historical terrestrial carbon sink as simulated by JULES. Between the 1900s and 2000s, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels enhanced vegetation productivity and litter inputs into the soils, while land use change removed vegetation and reduced soil carbon. result is a simulated increase in soil carbon of 57\\u2009Pg\\u2009C but a decrease in vegetation carbon of 98\\u2009Pg\\u2009C. The total simulated loss of soil and vegetation carbon due to land use change is 138\\u2009Pg\\u2009C from 1900 to 2009, compared to a recent observationally constrained estimate of 155\\u2009±\\u200950\\u2009Pg\\u2009C from 1901 to 2012. The simulated land carbon sink is 2.0\\u2009±\\u20091.0\\u2009Pg\\u2009C\\u2009yr−1 from 2000 to 2009, in close agreement with estimates from the IPCC and Global Carbon Project. Climate model configurations of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS cycle 43r1) for HighResMIP Abstract. This paper presents atmosphere-only and coupled climate model configurations of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) for different combinations of ocean and atmosphere resolution. These configurations are used to perform multi-decadal ensemble experiments following the protocols of the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) and phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are used to evaluate the sensitivity of major biases in the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere to changes in atmosphere and ocean resolution. All configurations successfully reproduce the observed long-term trends in global mean surface temperature. Furthermore, following an adjustment to account for drift in the subsurface ocean, coupled configurations of ECMWF-IFS realistically reproduce observation-based estimates of ocean heat content change since 1950. Climatological surface biases in ECMWF-IFS are relatively insensitive to an increase in atmospheric resolution from \\u2009∼\\u200950 to \\u2009∼\\u200925\\u2009km. However, increasing the horizontal resolution of the atmosphere while maintaining the same vertical resolution enhances the magnitude of a cold bias in the lower stratosphere. In coupled configurations, there is a strong sensitivity to an increase in ocean model resolution from 1 to 0.25°. However, this sensitivity to ocean resolution takes many years to fully manifest and is less apparent in the first year of integration. This result has implications for the ECMWF coupled model development strategy that typically relies on the analysis of biases in short (\\u2009<\\u20091\\xa0year) ensemble (re)forecast data sets. The impacts of increased ocean resolution are particularly evident in the North Atlantic and Arctic, where they are associated with an improved Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, increased meridional ocean heat transport, and more realistic sea-ice cover. In the tropical Pacific, increased ocean resolution is associated with improvements to the magnitude and asymmetry of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability and better representation of non-linear sea surface temperature (SST)–radiation feedbacks during warm events. However, increased ocean model resolution also increases the magnitude of a warm bias in the Southern Ocean. Finally, there is tentative evidence that both ocean coupling and increased atmospheric resolution can improve teleconnections between tropical Pacific rainfall and geopotential height anomalies in the North Atlantic. The global aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3  – Part 1: Aerosol evaluation Abstract. We introduce and evaluate aerosol simulations with the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3, which is the aerosol component of the fully coupled aerosol–chemistry–climate model ECHAM–HAMMOZ. Both the host atmospheric climate model ECHAM6.3 and the aerosol model HAM2.3 were updated from previous versions. The updated version of the HAM aerosol model contains improved parameterizations of aerosol processes such as cloud activation, as well as updated emission fields for anthropogenic aerosol species and modifications in the online computation of sea salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions. Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low. Both mineral dust and sea salt aerosol concentrations are improved compared to previous versions of ECHAM–HAM. The evaluation of the simulated aerosol distributions serves as a basis for the suitability of the model for simulating aerosol–climate interactions in a changing climate. Sensitivity of deep ocean biases to horizontal resolution in prototype CMIP6 simulations with AWI-CM1.0 Abstract. Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) show substantial biases in the deep ocean that are larger than the level of natural variability and the response to enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations. Here, we analyze the influence of horizontal resolution in a hierarchy of five multi-resolution simulations with the AWI Climate Model (AWI-CM), the climate model used at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, which employs a sea ice–ocean model component formulated on unstructured meshes. The ocean grid sizes considered range from a nominal resolution of ∼1∘ (CMIP5 type) up to locally eddy resolving. We show that increasing ocean resolution locally to resolve ocean eddies leads to reductions in deep ocean biases, although these improvements are not strictly monotonic for the five different ocean grids. A detailed diagnosis of the simulations allows to identify the origins of the biases. We find that two key regions at the surface are responsible for the development of the deep bias in the Atlantic Ocean: the northeastern North Atlantic and the region adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar. Furthermore, the Southern Ocean density structure is equally improved with locally explicitly resolved eddies compared to parameterized eddies. Part of the bias reduction can be traced back towards improved surface biases over outcropping regions, which are in contact with deeper ocean layers along isopycnal surfaces. Our prototype simulations provide guidance for the optimal choice of ocean grids for AWI-CM to be used in the final runs for phase 6 of CMIP (CMIP6) and for the related flagship simulations in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). Quite remarkably, retaining resolution only in areas of high eddy activity along with excellent scalability characteristics of the unstructured-mesh sea ice–ocean model enables us to perform the multi-centennial climate simulations needed in a CMIP context at (locally) eddy-resolving resolution with a throughput of 5–6 simulated years per day. Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2) for the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) Abstract. As a contribution towards improving the climate mean state of the atmosphere and the ocean in Earth system models (ESMs), we compare several coupled simulations conducted with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM1.2) following the HighResMIP protocol. Our simulations allow to analyse the separate effects of increasing the horizontal resolution of the ocean (0.4 to 0.1∘) and atmosphere (T127 to T255) submodels, and the effects of substituting the Pacanowski and Philander (PP) vertical ocean mixing scheme with the K-profile parameterization (KPP). The results show clearly distinguishable effects from all three factors. The high resolution in the ocean removes biases in the ocean interior and in the atmosphere. This leads to the important conclusion that a high-resolution ocean has a major impact on the mean state of the ocean and the atmosphere. The T255 atmosphere reduces the surface wind stress and improves ocean mixed layer depths in both hemispheres. The reduced wind forcing, in turn, slows the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), reducing it to observed values. In the North Atlantic, however, the reduced surface wind causes a weakening of the subpolar gyre and thus a slowing down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), when the PP scheme is used. The KPP scheme, on the other hand, causes stronger open-ocean convection which spins up the subpolar gyres, ultimately leading to a stronger and stable AMOC, even when coupled to the T255 atmosphere, thus retaining all the positive effects of a higher-resolved atmosphere. The global aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 – Part 2: Cloud evaluation, aerosol radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity Abstract. The global aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 (E63H23) as well as the previous model versions ECHAM5.5–HAM2.0 (E55H20) and ECHAM6.1–HAM2.2 (E61H22) are evaluated using global observational datasets for clouds and precipitation. In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM–HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23. Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFari+aci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFari+aci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFari+aci is weaker in E63H23 (−1.0\\u2009W\\u2009m−2) than in E61H22 (−1.2\\u2009W\\u2009m−2) (or E55H20; −1.1\\u2009W\\u2009m−2). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFari+aci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFari+aci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22). The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5\\u2009K) compared to E61H22 (2.8\\u2009K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback. Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40\\u2009cm−3 or 10\\u2009cm−3 show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFari+aci as well as ECS in E63H23. Description of the resolution hierarchy of the global coupled HadGEM3-GC3.1 model as used in CMIP6 HighResMIP experiments Abstract. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) HighResMIP is a new experimental design for global climate model simulations that aims to assess the impact of model horizontal resolution on climate simulation fidelity. We describe a hierarchy of global coupled model resolutions based on the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model 3 – Global Coupled vn 3.1 (HadGEM3-GC3.1) model that ranges from an atmosphere–ocean resolution of 130\\u2009km–1∘ to 25\\u2009km–1∕12∘, all using the same forcings and initial conditions. In order to make such high-resolution simulations possible, the experiments have a short 30-year spinup, followed by at least century-long simulations with constant forcing to assess drift. We assess the change in model biases as a function of both atmosphere and ocean resolution, together with the effectiveness and robustness of this new experimental design. We find reductions in the biases in top-of-atmosphere radiation components and cloud forcing. There are significant reductions in some common surface climate model biases as resolution is increased, particularly in the Atlantic for sea surface temperature and precipitation, primarily driven by increased ocean resolution. There is also a reduction in drift from the initial conditions both at the surface and in the deeper ocean at higher resolution. Using an eddy-present and eddy-rich ocean resolution enhances the strength of the North Atlantic ocean circulation (boundary currents, overturning circulation and heat transport), while an eddy-present ocean resolution has a considerably reduced Antarctic Circumpolar Current strength. All models have a reasonable representation of El Niño–Southern Oscillation. In general, the biases present after 30\\xa0years of simulations do not change character markedly over longer timescales, justifying the experimental design. High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest the possibility for significant changes in both large-scale aspects of circulation, as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. However, such high resolution global simulations at climate time scales, with resolutions of at least 50 km in the atmosphere and 0.25&amp;#176; in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centers and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other MIPs. Increases in High Performance Computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enables a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution. A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility to extend to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulation. HighResMIP thereby focuses on one of the CMIP6 broad questions: &amp;#8220;what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?&amp;#8221;, but we also discuss how it addresses the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) grand challenges.&lt;/p&gt; Attributing the 2017 Bangladesh floods from meteorological and\\nhydrological perspectives &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; In August 2017 Bangladesh faced one of its worst river flooding events in recent history. This paper presents for the first time an attribution of this precipitation-induced flooding from a combined meteorological and hydrological perspective. Experiments were conducted with three observational data sets and two climate models to estimate changes in extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the Brahmaputra basin. The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness of the attribution results to be assessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In all three observational precipitation data sets the climate change trends for extreme precipitation similar to observed in August 2017 are not significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this insignificant trend is positive. One climate model shows a significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the other simulates a cancellation between the increase due to greenhouse gases and a decrease due to sulphate aerosols. Considering discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less uncertain than for precipitation, but the 95&amp;#8201;% confidence interval still encompasses no change in risk. For the future, all models project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2&amp;#8201;&amp;#176;C global heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7 times more likely for high 10-day precipitation, and about a factor 1.5 more likely for discharge. Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the Brahmaputra event of August 2017 is derived by synthesizing the observational and model results: We find the change in risk to be greater than one and of similar order of magnitude (between 1 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach. This study shows that, for precipitation-induced flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as an alternative when hydrological models are not available, or as an additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions. Besides, it highlights the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols.&lt;/p&gt; Mean and extreme precipitation over European river basins better simulated in a 25&thinsp;km AGCM Abstract. Limited spatial resolution is one of the factors that may hamper applications of global climate models (GCMs), in particular over Europe with its complex coastline and orography. In this study, the representation of European mean and extreme precipitation is evaluated in simulations with an atmospheric GCM (AGCM) at different resolutions between about 135 and 25\\u2009km grid spacing in the mid-latitudes. The continent-wide root-mean-square error in mean precipitation in the 25\\u2009km model is about 25\\u2009\\u2009% smaller than in the 135\\u2009km model in winter. Clear improvements are also seen in autumn and spring, whereas the model\\'s sensitivity to resolution is very small in summer. Extreme precipitation is evaluated by estimating generalised extreme value distributions (GEVs) of daily precipitation aggregated over river basins whose surface area is greater than 50\\u2009000\\u2009km2. GEV location and scale parameters are measures of the typical magnitude and of the interannual variability of extremes, respectively. Median model biases in both these parameters are around 10\\u2009% in summer and around 20\\u2009% in the other seasons. For some river basins, however, these biases can be much larger and take values between 50\\u2009% and 100\\u2009%. Extreme precipitation is better simulated in the 25\\u2009km model, especially during autumn when the median GEV parameter biases are more than halved, and in the North European Plains, from the Loire in the west to the Vistula in the east. A sensitivity experiment is conducted showing that these resolution sensitivities in both mean and extreme precipitation are in many areas primarily due to the increase in resolution of the model orography. The findings of this study illustrate the improved capability of a global high-resolution model in simulating European mean and extreme precipitation. Attributing the 2017 Bangladesh floods from meteorological and hydrological perspectives Abstract. In August 2017 Bangladesh faced one of its worst river flooding events in recent history. This paper presents, for the first time, an attribution of this precipitation-induced flooding to anthropogenic climate change from a combined meteorological and hydrological perspective. Experiments were conducted with three observational datasets and two climate models to estimate changes in the extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the Brahmaputra basin up to the present and, additionally, an outlook to 2\\u2009∘C warming since pre-industrial times. The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness of the attribution results to be assessed. In all three observational precipitation datasets the climate change trends for extreme precipitation similar to that observed in August 2017 are not significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this insignificant trend is positive. One climate model ensemble shows a significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the other large ensemble model simulates a cancellation between the increase due to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and a decrease due to sulfate aerosols. Considering discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less uncertain than in precipitation, but the 95\\u2009% confidence intervals still encompass no change in risk. Extending the analysis to the future, all models project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2\\u2009∘C global heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7\\xa0times more likely for high 10-day precipitation and being more likely by a factor of about 1.5 for discharge. Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the Brahmaputra event of August\\xa02017 is derived by synthesizing the observational and model results: we find the change in risk to be greater than 1 and of a similar order of magnitude (between\\xa01 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach. This study shows that, for precipitation-induced flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as an alternative when hydrological models are not available or as an additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions. Besides this, it highlights the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols. Upgraded global mapping information for earth system modelling: an application to surface water depth at the ECMWF Abstract. Water\\xa0bodies influence local weather and climate, especially in lake-rich areas. The FLake (Fresh-water Lake model) parameterisation is employed in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model which is used operationally to produce global weather predictions. Lake depth and lake fraction are the main driving parameters in the FLake parameterisation. The lake parameter fields for the IFS should be global and realistic, because FLake runs over all the grid boxes, and then only lake-related results are used further. In this study new datasets and methods for generating lake fraction and lake depth fields for the IFS are proposed. The data include the new version of the Global Lake Database (GLDBv3) which contains depth estimates for unstudied lakes based on a geological approach, the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans and the Global Surface Water Explorer dataset which contains information on the spatial and temporal variability of surface water. The first new method suggested is a two-step lake fraction calculation; the first step is at 1\\u2009km grid resolution and the second is at the resolution of other grids in the IFS system. The second new method involves the use of a novel algorithm for ocean and inland water separation. This new algorithm may be used by anyone in the environmental modelling community. To assess the impact of using these innovations, in situ measurements of lake depth, lake water surface temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates for 27\\xa0lakes collected by the Finnish Environment Institute were used. A set of offline experiments driven by atmospheric forcing from the ECMWF ERA5 Reanalysis were carried out using the IFS HTESSEL land surface model. In terms of lake depth, the new dataset shows a much lower mean absolute error, bias and error standard deviation compared to the reference set-up. In terms of lake water surface temperature, the mean absolute error is reduced by 13.4\\u2009%, the bias by 12.5\\u2009% and the error standard deviation by 20.3\\u2009%. Seasonal verification of the mixed layer depth temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates revealed a cold bias in the meteorological forcing from ERA5. Spring, summer and autumn verification scores confirm an overall reduction in the surface water temperature errors. For winter, no statistically significant change in the ice formation/disappearance date errors was detected. Historical and future changes in global flood magnitude &amp;#8211;  evidence from a model&amp;#8211;observation investigation Abstract. To improve the understanding of trends in extreme flows related to flood events at the global scale, historical and future changes of annual maxima of 7\\u2009d streamflow are investigated, using a comprehensive streamflow archive and six global hydrological models. The models\\' capacity to characterise trends in annual maxima of 7\\u2009d streamflow at the continental and global scale is evaluated across 3666\\xa0river gauge locations over the period from\\xa01971 to\\xa02005, focusing on four aspects of trends: (i)\\xa0mean, (ii)\\xa0standard deviation, (iii)\\xa0percentage of locations showing significant trends and (iv)\\xa0spatial pattern. Compared to observed trends, simulated trends driven by observed climate forcing generally have a higher mean, lower spread and a similar percentage of locations showing significant trends. Models show a low to moderate capacity to simulate spatial patterns of historical trends, with approximately only from 12\\u2009% to 25\\u2009% of the spatial variance of observed trends across all gauge stations accounted for by the simulations. Interestingly, there are statistically significant differences between trends simulated by global hydrological models\\xa0(GHMs) forced with observational climate and by those forced by bias-corrected climate model output during the historical period, suggesting the important role of the stochastic natural (decadal, inter-annual) climate variability. Significant differences were found in simulated flood trends when averaged only at gauged locations compared to those averaged across all simulated grid cells, highlighting the potential for bias toward well-observed regions in our understanding of changes in floods. Future climate projections (simulated under the RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenarios) suggest a potentially high level of change in individual regions, with up to 35\\u2009% of cells showing a statistically significant trend (increase or decrease; at 10\\u2009% significance level) and greater changes indicated for the higher concentration pathway. Importantly, the observed streamflow database under-samples the percentage of locations consistently projected with increased flood hazards under the RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenario by more than an order of magnitude (0.9\\u2009% compared to 11.7\\u2009%). This finding indicates a highly uncertain future for both flood-prone communities and decision makers in the context of climate change. The impact of drought on the productivity of two rainfed crops in Spain Abstract. Drought events are of great importance in most Mediterranean climate regions because of the diverse and costly impacts they have in various economic sectors and on the environment. The effects of this natural hazard on rainfed crops are particularly evident. In this study the impacts of drought on two representative rainfed crops in Spain (wheat and barley) were assessed. As the agriculture sector is vulnerable to climate, it is especially important to identify the most appropriate tools for monitoring the impact of the weather on crops, and particularly the impact of drought. Drought indices are the most effective tool for that purpose. Various drought indices have been used to assess the influence of drought on crop yields in Spain, including the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Palmer drought indices (Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI; Palmer Z Index, Z Index; Palmer Hydrological Drought Index, PHDI; Palmer Modified Drought Index, PMDI), and the Standardized Palmer Drought Index (SPDI). Two sets of crop yield data at different spatial scales and temporal periods were used in the analysis. The results showed that drought indices calculated at different timescales (SPI, SPEI) most closely correlated with crop yield. The results also suggested that different patterns of yield response to drought occurred depending on the region, period of the year, and the drought timescale. The differing responses across the country were related to season and the magnitude of various climate variables. High-spatial-resolution probability maps of drought  duration and magnitude across Spain Abstract. Assessing the probability of occurrence of drought is important for improving current drought assessment, management and mitigation measures, and strategies across Spain. This study employed two well-established drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index\\xa0(SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index\\xa0(SPEI), to characterize drought duration and magnitude at different timescales over Spain. In order to map the drought hazard probability, we applied the extreme value theory and tested different thresholds to generate peak-over-threshold\\xa0(POT) drought duration and magnitude series. Our results demonstrate that the generalized Pareto\\xa0(GP) distribution performs well in estimating the frequencies of drought magnitude and duration. Specifically, we found a good agreement between the observed and modelled data when using upper percentiles to generate the POT series. Spatially, our estimations suggest a higher probability of extreme drought events in southern and central Spain compared to the northern and eastern regions. Also, our study found spatial differences in drought probability estimations as a function of the selected drought index (i.e. SPI vs.\\xa0SPEI) and timescale (i.e.\\xa01, 3, 6, and 12 months). Drought hazard probability maps can contribute to the better management of different sectors (e.g.\\xa0agriculture, water resources management, urban water supply, and tourism) at national, regional, and even local scale in Spain. Summertime precipitation extremes in a EURO-CORDEX 0.11° ensemble at an hourly resolution Abstract. Regional climate model simulations have routinely been applied to assess changes in precipitation extremes at daily time steps. However, shorter sub-daily extremes have not received as much attention. This is likely because of the limited availability of high temporal resolution data, both for observations and for model outputs. Here, summertime depth duration frequencies of a subset of the EURO-CORDEX 0.11∘ ensemble are evaluated with observations for several European countries for durations of 1 to 12\\u2009h. Most of the model simulations strongly underestimate 10-year depths for durations up to a few hours but perform better at longer durations. The spatial patterns over Germany are reproduced at least partly at a 12\\u2009h duration, but all models fail at shorter durations. Projected changes are assessed by relating relative depth changes to mean temperature changes. A strong relationship with temperature is found across different subregions of Europe, emission scenarios and future time periods. However, the scaling varies considerably between different combinations of global and regional climate models, with a spread in scaling of around 1–10\\u2009%\\u2009K−1 at a 12\\u2009h duration and generally higher values at shorter durations. Snow water equivalent in the Alps as seen by gridded data sets, CMIP5 and CORDEX climate models Abstract. The estimate of the current and future conditions of snow resources in mountain areas would require reliable, kilometre-resolution, regional-observation-based gridded data sets and climate models capable of properly representing snow processes and snow–climate interactions. At the moment, the development of such tools is hampered by the sparseness of station-based reference observations. In past decades passive microwave remote sensing and reanalysis products have mainly been used to infer information on the snow water equivalent distribution. However, the investigation has usually been limited to flat terrains as the reliability of these products in mountain areas is poorly characterized.This work considers the available snow water equivalent data sets from remote sensing and from reanalyses for the greater Alpine region (GAR), and explores their ability to provide a coherent view of the snow water equivalent distribution and climatology in this area. Further we analyse the simulations from the latest-generation regional and global climate models (RCMs, GCMs), participating in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment over the European domain (EURO-CORDEX) and in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) respectively. We evaluate their reliability in reproducing the main drivers of snow processes – near-surface air temperature and precipitation – against the observational data set EOBS, and compare the snow water equivalent climatology with the remote sensing and reanalysis data sets previously considered. We critically discuss the model limitations in the historical period and we explore their potential in providing reliable future projections.The results of the analysis show that the time-averaged spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and the amplitude of its annual cycle are reproduced quite differently by the different remote sensing and reanalysis data sets, which in fact exhibit a large spread around the ensemble mean. We find that GCMs at spatial resolutions equal to or finer than 1.25° longitude are in closer agreement with the ensemble mean of satellite and reanalysis products in terms of root mean square error and standard deviation than lower-resolution GCMs. The set of regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble provides estimates of snow water equivalent at 0.11° resolution that are locally much larger than those indicated by the gridded data sets, and only in a few cases are these differences smoothed out when snow water equivalent is spatially averaged over the entire Alpine domain. ERA-Interim-driven RCM simulations show an annual snow cycle that is comparable in amplitude to those provided by the reference data sets, while GCM-driven RCMs present a large positive bias. RCMs and higher-resolution GCM simulations are used to provide an estimate of the snow reduction expected by the mid-21st century (RCP 8.5 scenario) compared to the historical climatology, with the main purpose of highlighting the limits of our current knowledge and the need for developing more reliable snow simulations. Relationships between Arctic sea ice drift and strength modelled by NEMO-LIM3.6 Abstract. Sea ice cover and thickness have substantially decreased in the Arctic Ocean since the beginning of the satellite era. As a result, sea ice strength has been reduced, allowing more deformation and fracturing and leading to increased sea ice drift speed. We use the version 3.6 of the global ocean–sea ice NEMO-LIM model (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean coupled to the Louvain-la-Neuve sea Ice Model), satellite, buoy and submarine observations, as well as reanalysis data over the period from 1979 to 2013 to study these relationships. Overall, the model agrees well with observations in terms of sea ice extent, concentration and thickness. The seasonal cycle of sea ice drift speed is reasonably well reproduced by the model. NEMO-LIM3.6 is able to capture the relationships between the seasonal cycles of sea ice drift speed, concentration and thickness, with higher drift speed for both lower concentration and lower thickness, in agreement with observations. Model experiments are carried out to test the sensitivity of Arctic sea ice drift speed, thickness and concentration to changes in sea ice strength parameter P*. These show that higher values of P* generally lead to lower sea ice deformation and lower sea ice thickness, and that no single value of P* is the best option for reproducing the observed drift speed and thickness. The methodology proposed in this analysis provides a benchmark for a further model intercomparison related to the relationships between sea ice drift speed and strength, which is especially relevant in the context of the upcoming Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Winter tourism under climate change in the Pyrenees and the French Alps: relevance of snowmaking as a technical adaptation Abstract. Climate change is increasingly regarded as a threat for winter tourism due to the combined effect of decreasing natural snow amounts and decreasing suitable periods for snowmaking. The present work investigated the snow reliability of 175\\xa0ski resorts in France (Alps and Pyrenees), Spain and Andorra under past and future conditions using state-of-the-art snowpack modelling and climate projections using Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The natural snow reliability (i.e. without snowmaking) elevation showed a significant spatial variability in the reference period (1986–2005) and was shown to be highly impacted by the ongoing climate change. The reliability elevation using snowmaking is projected to rise by 200 to 300\\u2009m in the Alps and by 400 to 600\\u2009m in the Pyrenees in the near future (2030–2050) compared to the reference period for all climate scenarios. While 99\\u2009% of ski lift infrastructures exhibit adequate snow reliability in the reference period when using snowmaking, a significant fraction (14\\u2009% to 25\\u2009%) may be considered in a critical situation in the near future. Beyond the mid-century, climate projections highly depend on the scenario with either steady conditions compared to the near future (RCP2.6) or continuous decrease in snow reliability (RCP8.5). Under RCP8.5, our projections show that there would no longer be any snow-reliable ski resorts based on natural snow conditions in the French Alps and Pyrenees (France, Spain and Andorra) at the end of the century (2080–2100). For this time period and this scenario, only 24\\xa0resorts are projected to remain reliable with snowmaking, all being located in the Alps. On the timescales and length scales of the Arctic sea ice thickness anomalies: a study based on 14 reanalyses Abstract. The ocean–sea ice reanalyses are one of the main sources of Arctic sea ice thickness data both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, since observations are still sparse in time and space. In this work, we first aim at comparing how the sea ice thickness from an ensemble of 14 reanalyses compares with different sources of observations, such as moored upward-looking sonars, submarines, airbornes, satellites, and ice boreholes. Second, based on the same reanalyses, we intend to characterize the timescales (persistence) and length scales of sea ice thickness anomalies. We investigate whether data assimilation of sea ice concentration by the reanalyses impacts the realism of sea ice thickness as well as its respective timescales and length scales. The results suggest that reanalyses with sea ice data assimilation do not necessarily perform better in terms of sea ice thickness compared with the reanalyses which do not assimilate sea ice concentration. However, data assimilation has a clear impact on the timescales and length scales: reanalyses built with sea ice data assimilation present shorter timescales and length scales. The mean timescales and length scales for reanalyses with data assimilation vary from 2.5 to 5.0\\xa0months and 337.0 to 732.5\\u2009km, respectively, while reanalyses with no data assimilation are characterized by values from 4.9 to 7.8\\xa0months and 846.7 to 935.7\\u2009km, respectively. A Real-time Lattice Simulation of the Thermalization of a Gluon Plasma: First Results To achieve an understanding of the thermalization of a quark-gluon plasma, starting from QCD without using model assumptions, is a formidable task. We study the early stage dynamics of a relativistic heavy ion collision in the framework of real time simulations of classical Yang-Mills theory in a static box with the color glass condensate as initial condition. Our study generalizes a previous one by Fukushima and Gelis from SU(2) to the realistic case of SU(3). We calculate the chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic energy densities as well as the ratio of longitudinal and transverse pressure as a function of time as probes for thermalization. Our preliminary results on coarse lattices show the occurrence of Weibel instabilities prior to thermalization. Increasing Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into neurons Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development, yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms. In the C. elegans germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling. Conformational and dynamic plasticity in substrate-binding proteins underlies selective transport in ABC importers Substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) are associated with ATP-binding cassette importers and switch from an open to a closed conformation upon substrate binding, providing specificity for transport. We investigated the effect of substrates on the conformational dynamics of six SBPs and the impact on transport. Using single-molecule FRET, we reveal an unrecognized diversity of plasticity in SBPs. We show that a unique closed SBP conformation does not exist for transported substrates. Instead, SBPs sample a range of conformations that activate transport. Certain non-transported ligands leave the structure largely unaltered or trigger a conformation distinct from that of transported substrates. Intriguingly, in some cases, similar SBP conformations are formed by both transported and non-transported ligands. In this case, the inability for transport arises from slow opening of the SBP or the selectivity provided by the translocator. Our results reveal the complex interplay between ligand-SBP interactions, SBP conformational dynamics and substrate transport.'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":239}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3AloTdijFQI9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630482718303,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":6516,"user":{"displayName":"Anastasia

Several immunoassays have been developed to measure β-amyloid (Aβ) 42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The agreement between CSF Aβ42 measures from different immunoassays and visual PET readings may influence the use of CSF biomarkers and/or amyloid PET assessment in clinical practice and trials. Objective To determine the concordance between CSF Aβ42 levels measured using 5 different immunoassays and visual amyloid PET analysis. Design, Setting, and Participants The study included 262 patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline from the Swedish BioFINDER (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) cohort (recruited from September 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014) who had undergone flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flutemetamol)–labeled PET. Levels of CSF Aβ42 were analyzed using the classic INNOTEST and the newer modified INNOTEST, fully automated Lumipulse (FL), EUROIMMUN (EI), and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays. Concentrations of CSF Aβ were assessed using an antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure. Main Outcomes and Measures The concordance of CSF Aβ42 levels and Aβ42:Aβ40 and Aβ42:tau ratios with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status. Results Of 262 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [5.5] years), 108 were women (41.2%) and 154 were men (58.8%). The mass spectrometry–derived Aβ42 values showed higher correlations with the modified Aβ42-INNOTEST (r = 0.97), Aβ42-FL (r = 0.93), Aβ42-EI (r = 0.93), and Aβ42-MSD (r = 0.95) assays compared with the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay (r = 0.88;P ≤ .01). The signal in the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay was partly quenched by recombinant Aβ1-40 peptide. However, the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay showed better concordance with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.92) compared with the newer assays (AUCs, 0.87-0.89;P ≤ .01). The accuracies of the newer assays improved significantly when Aβ42:Aβ40 (AUCs, 0.93-0.95;P ≤ .01), Aβ42 to total tau (T-tau) (AUCs, 0.94;P ≤ .05), or Aβ42 to phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (AUCs, 0.94-0.95;P ≤ .001) ratios were used. A combination of the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and T-tau or P-tau level did not improve the accuracy compared with the ratio alone. Conclusions and Relevance Concentrations of CSF Aβ42 derived from the new immunoassays (modified INNOTEST, FL, EI, and MSD) may correlate better with the antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure and may show improved agreement with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET assessment when using the Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios. These findings suggest the benefit of implementing the CSF Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios as a biomarker of amyloid deposition in clinical practice and trials.\n","**************************************************\n","concordance different amyloid immunoassays visual amyloid positron emission tomographic assessment importance visual assessment

Models of comparable resolution differ over land by as much as 20% in zonal mean total subgrid surface stress (τtot). The way τtot is partitioned between the different parameterizations is also model‐dependent. In this study, we simulated in a particular model an increase in τtot comparable with the spread found in the WGNE intercomparison. This increase was simulated in two ways, namely by increasing independently the contributions to τtot of the turbulent orographic form drag scheme (TOFD) and of the orographic low‐level blocking scheme (BLOCK). Increasing the parameterized orographic drag leads to significant changes in surface pressure, zonal wind and temperature in the Northern Hemisphere during winter both in 10 day weather forecasts and in seasonal integrations. However, the magnitude of these changes in circulation strongly depends on which scheme is modified. In 10 day forecasts, stronger changes are found when the TOFD stress is increased, while on seasonal time scales the effects are of comparable magnitude, although different in detail. At these time scales, the BLOCK scheme affects the lower stratosphere winds through changes in the resolved planetary waves which are associated with surface impacts, while the TOFD effects are mostly limited to the lower troposphere. The partitioning of τtot between the two schemes appears to play an important role at all time scales.\n","\n","\n","Select strengths and biases of models in representing the Arctic winter boundary layer over sea ice: the Larcform 1 single column model intercomparison Weather and climate models struggle to represent lower tropospheric temperature and moisture profiles and surface fluxes in Arctic winter, partly because they lack or misrepresent physical processes that are specific to high latitudes. Observations have revealed two preferred states of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water limits surface radiative cooling, and temperature inversions are weak and elevated. In the radiatively clear state, strong surface radiative cooling leads to the build‐up of surface‐based temperature inversions. Many large‐scale models lack the cloudy state, and some substantially underestimate inversion strength in the clear state. Here, the transformation from a moist to a cold dry air mass is modeled using an idealized Lagrangian perspective. The trajectory includes both boundary layer states, and the single‐column experiment is the first Lagrangian Arctic air formation experiment (Larcform 1) organized within GEWEX GASS (Global atmospheric system studies). The intercomparison reproduces the typical biases of large‐scale models: some models lack the cloudy state of the boundary layer due to the representation of mixed‐phase microphysics or to the interaction between micro‐ and macrophysics. In some models, high emissivities of ice clouds or the lack of an insulating snow layer prevent the build‐up of surface‐based inversions in the radiatively clear state. Models substantially disagree on the amount of cloud liquid water in the cloudy state and on turbulent heat fluxes under clear skies. Observations of air mass transformations including both boundary layer states would allow for a tighter constraint of model behavior.

Solution-processed hybrid organohalide perovskites, which have been extensively used in the last few years for optoelectronic applications, are characterized by a self-assembled nanostructured morphology, which makes them an ideal candidate for gas sensing. Hitherto, detailed studies of the dependence of their electrical characteristics on the environmental atmosphere have not been performed, and even the effect of a ubiquitous gas such as O2 has been widely overlooked. Here, the electrical response of organohalide perovskites to oxygen is studied. Surprisingly, a colossal increase (3000-fold) in the resistance of perovskite-based lateral devices is found when measured in a full oxygen atmosphere, which is ascribed to a trap healing mechanism originating from an O2 -mediated iodine vacancies filling. A variation as small as 70 ppm in the oxygen concentration can be detected. The effect is fast (<400 ms) and fully reversible, making organohalide perovskites ideal active materials for oxygen sensing. The effect of oxygen on the electrical characteristics of organohalide perovskites must be taken into deep consideration for the design and optimization of any other perovskite-based (opto-) electronic device working in ambient conditions.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  2\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Concordance Between Different Amyloid Immunoassays and Visual Amyloid Positron Emission Tomographic Assessment Importance Visual assessment of amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) images has been approved by regulatory authorities for clinical use. Several immunoassays have been developed to measure β-amyloid (Aβ) 42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The agreement between CSF Aβ42 measures from different immunoassays and visual PET readings may influence the use of CSF biomarkers and/or amyloid PET assessment in clinical practice and trials. Objective To determine the concordance between CSF Aβ42 levels measured using 5 different immunoassays and visual amyloid PET analysis. Design, Setting, and Participants The study included 262 patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline from the Swedish BioFINDER (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) cohort (recruited from September 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014) who had undergone flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flutemetamol)–labeled PET. Levels of CSF Aβ42 were analyzed using the classic INNOTEST and the newer modified INNOTEST, fully automated Lumipulse (FL), EUROIMMUN (EI), and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays. Concentrations of CSF Aβ were assessed using an antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure. Main Outcomes and Measures The concordance of CSF Aβ42 levels and Aβ42:Aβ40 and Aβ42:tau ratios with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status. Results Of 262 participants (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [5.5] years), 108 were women (41.2%) and 154 were men (58.8%). The mass spectrometry–derived Aβ42 values showed higher correlations with the modified Aβ42-INNOTEST (r = 0.97), Aβ42-FL (r = 0.93), Aβ42-EI (r = 0.93), and Aβ42-MSD (r = 0.95) assays compared with the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay (r = 0.88;P ≤ .01). The signal in the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay was partly quenched by recombinant Aβ1-40 peptide. However, the classic Aβ42-INNOTEST assay showed better concordance with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.92) compared with the newer assays (AUCs, 0.87-0.89;P ≤ .01). The accuracies of the newer assays improved significantly when Aβ42:Aβ40 (AUCs, 0.93-0.95;P ≤ .01), Aβ42 to total tau (T-tau) (AUCs, 0.94;P ≤ .05), or Aβ42 to phosphorylated tau (P-tau) (AUCs, 0.94-0.95;P ≤ .001) ratios were used. A combination of the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and T-tau or P-tau level did not improve the accuracy compared with the ratio alone. Conclusions and Relevance Concentrations of CSF Aβ42 derived from the new immunoassays (modified INNOTEST, FL, EI, and MSD) may correlate better with the antibody-independent mass spectrometry–based reference measurement procedure and may show improved agreement with visual [18F]flutemetamol PET assessment when using the Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios. These findings suggest the benefit of implementing the CSF Aβ42:Aβ40 or Aβ42:tau ratios as a biomarker of amyloid deposition in clinical practice and trials.\n","\n","\n","A New Pathology in the Simulation of Chaotic Dynamical Systems on Digital Computers Systematic distortions are uncovered in the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems when represented and simulated on digital computers using standard IEEE floating‐point numbers. This is done by studying a model chaotic dynamical system with a single free parameter β, known as the generalized Bernoulli map, many of whose exact properties are known. Much of the structure of the dynamical system is lost in the floating‐point representation. For even integer values of the parameter, the long time behaviour is completely wrong, subsuming the known anomalous behaviour for β = 2. For non‐integer β, relative errors in observables can reach 14%. For odd integer values of β, floating‐point results are more accurate, but still produce relative errors two orders of magnitude larger than those attributable to roundoff. The analysis indicates that the pathology described, which cannot be mitigated by increasing the precision of the floating point numbers, is a representative example of a deeper problem in the computation of expectation values for chaotic systems. The findings sound a warning about the uncritical application of numerical methods in studies of the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems, such as are routinely performed throughout computational science, including turbulence and molecular dynamics.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  3\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Genetic studies of abdominal MRI data identify genes regulating hepcidin as major determinants of liver iron concentration Background & Aims Excess liver iron content is common and is linked to the risk of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We aimed to identify genetic variants influencing liver iron content and use genetics to understand its link to other traits and diseases. Methods First, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,289 individuals from UK Biobank, whose liver iron level had been quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, before validating our findings in an independent cohort (n = 1,513 from IMI DIRECT). Second, we used Mendelian randomisation to test the causal effects of 25 predominantly metabolic traits on liver iron content. Third, we tested phenome-wide associations between liver iron variants and 770 traits and disease outcomes. Results We identified 3 independent genetic variants (rs1800562 [C282Y] and rs1799945 [H63D] in HFE and rs855791 [V736A] in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron content that reached the GWAS significance threshold (p <5 × 10−8). The 2 HFE variants account for ∼85% of all cases of hereditary haemochromatosis. Mendelian randomisation analysis provided evidence that higher central obesity plays a causal role in increased liver iron content. Phenome-wide association analysis demonstrated shared aetiopathogenic mechanisms for elevated liver iron, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and rheumatological conditions, while also highlighting inverse associations with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Conclusion Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying higher liver iron content are likely systemic rather than organ specific, that higher central obesity is causally associated with higher liver iron, and that liver iron shares common aetiology with multiple metabolic and non-metabolic diseases. Lay summary Excess liver iron content is common and is associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.\n","\n","\n","Transport Properties of Li-TFSI Water-in-Salt Electrolytes Water-in-salts are a new family of electrolytes that may allow the development of aqueous Li-ion batteries. They have a structure which is reminiscent of the one of ionic liquids, and they are characterized by a large concentration of ionic species. In this work we study their transport properties and how they evolve with concentration by using molecular dynamics simulations. We first focus on the choice of the force field. By comparing the simulated viscosities and self diffusion coefficients with experimental measurements, we select a set of parameters that reproduces well the transport properties. We then use the selected force field to study in detail the variations of the self and collective diffusivities of all the species as well as the transport number of the lithium ion. We show that correlation between ions and water play an important role over the whole concentration range. In the water-in-salt regime, the anions form a percolating network which reduces the cation-anion correlations and leads to rather large values for the transport number compared to other standard electrolytes.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  4\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Association of Changes in Plasma Neurofilament Light and Tau Levels With Anesthesia and Surgery Importance Anesthesia and surgery are believed to act on the central nervous system by a fully reversible mechanism innocuous to nerve cells. Evidence that neurological sequelae may follow would challenge this belief and would thereby suggest a need to reassess theories of the mechanism of anesthetic action or the response of the central nervous system to surgery. Objective To measure 2 biomarkers of neurological injury (neurofilament light and tau) in plasma in a series of timed collections before and after anesthesia and surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants These 2 related observational studies (CAPACITY and ARCADIAN) recruited patients 60 years and older who were undergoing general anesthesia for surgeries performed within a tertiary hospital. Blood samples were taken immediately before surgical anesthesia was administered and then sequentially after surgery at 30-minute, 6-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour intervals. Sampling took place from January 2014 to August 2015. Data analysis took place from October 2016 to February 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Plasma neurofilament light and tau. Results A total of 30 patients were enrolled (13 from the CAPACITY study and 17 from the ARCADIAN study). The mean (SD) age was 69.1 (7.0) years, and 18 members (59%) of the participant group were female; 22 (73%) were undergoing joint arthroplasty. Mean neurofilament light increased at each measurement from a combined baseline mean (SD) of 22.3 (20.4) pg/mL to a maximal combined mean (SD) level of 35.1 (28.7) pg/mL, a maximum increase of 67% (95% CI, 45%-89%;P  Conclusions and Relevance Neurofilament light is a specific marker of axonal injury and has been shown to indicate neuronal damage in a number of diseases. Tau proteins are an integral component of axonal integrity, and increased tau indicates neuronal damage. The increases in both neurofilament light and tau over 48 hours after surgery suggest that general anesthesia and surgery may be associated with neuronal damage in the short term. Further investigations will be required to study any association with clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings demand that we question the prevailing assumption that anesthesia and surgery are innocuous, transient, and without injurious changes to the central nervous system.\n","\n","\n","Dynamically triggered slip leading to sustained fault gouge weakening under laboratory shear conditions We investigate dynamic wave-triggered slip under laboratory shear conditions. The experiment is composed of a three-block system containing two gouge layers composed of glass beads and held in place by a fixed load in a biaxial configuration. When the system is sheared under steady state conditions at a normal load of 4 MPa, we find that shear failure may be instantaneously triggered by a dynamic wave, corresponding to material weakening and softening if the system is in a critical shear stress state (near failure). Following triggering, the gouge material remains in a perturbed state over multiple slip cycles as evidenced by the recovery of the material strength, shear modulus, and slip recurrence time. This work suggests that faults must be critically stressed to trigger under dynamic conditions and that the recovery process following a dynamically triggered event differs from the recovery following a spontaneous event.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  5\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Self-Assembly of an Amphiphilic π-Conjugated Dyad into Fibers: Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Humidity Sensor The self-assembly of an amphiphilic monomolecular electron acceptor-donor dyad into electroactive π-π stacked fibrillar structures can be triggered by irradiation with visible light.

Identifying new potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflecting this process could contribute important information on pathophysiology. 2 Experimental design A developed method combining SPE and PRM‐MS is employed to monitor the concentration of ubiquitin in CSF from subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Four independent cross‐sectional studies are conducted, studies 1–4, including controls (n = 86) and participants with AD (n = 60), PD (n = 15), and PSP (n = 11). 3 Results The method shows a repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 6.1 and 7.9%, respectively. The determined LOD is 0.1 nm and the LOQ range between 0.625 and 80 nm. The CSF ubiquitin concentration is 1.2–1.5‐fold higher in AD patients compared with controls in the three independent AD‐control studies (Study 1, p < 0.001; Study 2, p < 0.001; and Study 3, p = 0.003). In the fourth study, there is no difference in PD or PSP, compared to controls. 4 Conclusion and clinical relevance CSF ubiquitin may reflect dysfunctional proteostasis in AD. The described method can be used for further exploration of ubiquitin as a potential biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases.\n","\n","\n","Coding and non-coding variants in the SHOX2 gene in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia with a strong genetic component. Molecular pathways involving the homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 control the development and function of the cardiac conduction system in mouse and zebrafish. Here we report the analysis of human SHOX2 as a potential susceptibility gene for early-onset AF. To identify causal variants and define the underlying mechanisms, results from 378 patients with early-onset AF before the age of 60 years were analyzed and compared to 1870 controls or reference datasets. We identified two missense mutations (p.G81E, p.H283Q), that were predicted as damaging. Transactivation studies using SHOX2 targets and phenotypic rescue experiments in zebrafish demonstrated that the p.H283Q mutation severely affects SHOX2 pacemaker function. We also demonstrate an association between a 3′UTR variant c.*28T>C of SHOX2 and AF (p = 0.00515). Patients carrying this variant present significantly longer PR intervals. Mechanistically, this variant creates a functional binding site for hsa-miR-92b-5p. Circulating hsa-miR-92b-5p plasma levels were significantly altered in AF patients carrying the 3′UTR variant (p = 0.0095). Finally, we demonstrate significantly reduced SHOX2 expression levels in right atrial appendages of AF patients compared to patients with sinus rhythm. Together, these results suggest a genetic contribution of SHOX2 in early-onset AF.

From the spectroscopic point of view, such a tool has revealed details about the efficiency of charge pairs generation and conformational relaxation in p-conjugated molecules and macromolecules. In addition, PPP has been effectively utilised for modulating the gain signal in conjugated materials by taking advantage of the spectral overlap between stimulated emission and charge absorption in those systems. However, the relatively low stability of conjugated polymers under intense photoexcitation has been a crucial limitation for their real employment in plastic optical fibres (POFs) and for signal control applications. Here, we highlight the role of PPP for achieving ultrafast all-optical switching in p-conjugated systems. Furthermore, we report new experimental data on optical switching of a newly synthesised graphene molecule, namely dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBOV). The superior environmental and photostability of DBOV and, in general, of graphene nanostructures can represent a great advantage for their effective applications in POFs and information and communications technology.\n","\n","\n","Self-Suspended Nanomesh Scaffold for Ultrafast Flexible Photodetectors Based on Organic Semiconducting Crystals Self-standing nanostructures are of fundamental interest in materials science and nanoscience and are widely used in (opto-)electronic and photonic devices as well as in micro-electromechanical systems. To date, large-area and self-standing nanoelectrode arrays assembled on flexible substrates have not been reported. Here the fabrication of a hollow nanomesh scaffold on glass and plastic substrates with a large surface area over 1 mm2 and ultralow leakage current density (≈1-10 pA mm-2 @ 2 V) across the empty scaffold is demonstrated. Thanks to the continuous sub-micrometer space formed in between the nanomesh and the bottom electrode, highly crystalline and dendritic domains of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethinyl)pentacene growing within the hollow cavity can be observed. The high degree of order at the supramolecular level leads to efficient charge and exciton transport; the photovoltaic detector supported on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates exhibits an ultrafast photoresponse time as short as 8 ns and a signal-to-noise ratio approaching 105 . Such a hollow scaffold holds great potential as a novel device architecture toward flexible (opto-)electronic applications based on self-assembled micro/nanocrystals.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  8\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Is Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody-Positive Rheumatoid Arthritis Still a More Severe Disease Than Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibody-Negative Rheumatoid Arthritis? A Longitudinal Cohort Study in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Diagnosed From 2000 Onwar Objective Because of its association with joint destruction, anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)–positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered to be more severe than ACPA‐negative RA. Clinically relevant joint destruction is now infrequent thanks to adequate disease suppression. According to patients, important outcomes are pain, fatigue, and independence. We evaluated whether ACPA‐positive RA patients diagnosed during or after 2000 have more severe self‐reported limitations and impairments, including restrictions at work, than ACPA‐negative RA patients. Methods A total of 492 ACPA‐positive and 450 ACPA‐negative RA patients who fulfilled the 2010 criteria and were included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic cohort during or after 2000 were compared for self‐reported pain, fatigue, disease activity, general well‐being (measured by numerical rating scales), physical function (measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire), and work restrictions, including absenteeism at baseline and during the 4‐year followup. Linear mixed models were used. Results At disease presentation, ACPA‐negative patients had more severe pain, fatigue, self‐reported disease activity scores, and functional disability (P < 0.05), although absolute differences were small. During followup, ACPA‐negative patients remained somewhat more fatigued (P = 0.002), whereas other patient‐reported impairments and limitations were similar. Thirty‐eight percent of ACPA‐negative and 48% of ACPA‐positive patients reported absenteeism (P = 0.30), with median 4 days missed in both groups in the last 3 months. Also, restrictions at work among employed patients and restrictions with household work were not statistically different at baseline and during followup. Conclusion In current rheumatology practice, ACPA‐positive RA is not more severe than ACPA‐negative RA in terms of patients’ relevant outcomes, including physical functioning and restrictions at work. This implies that efforts to further improve the disease course should be proportional to both disease subsets.\n","\n","\n","qFIBS: A Novel Automated Technique for Quantitative Evaluation of Fibrosis, Inflammation, Ballooning, and Steatosis in Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis [Approach and Results] Images were acquired by SHG/TPEF from 219 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH liver biopsy samples from seven centers in Asia and Europe. These were used to develop and validate qFIBS, a computational algorithm that quantifies key histological features of NASH. qFIBS was developed based on in silico analysis of selected signature parameters for four cardinal histopathological features, that is, fibrosis (qFibrosis), inflammation (qInflammation), hepatocyte ballooning (qBallooning), and steatosis (qSteatosis), treating each as a continuous rather than categorical variable. Automated qFIBS analysis outputs showed strong correlation with each respective component of the NASH CRN scoring (P < 0.001; qFibrosis [r = 0.776], qInflammation [r = 0.557], qBallooning [r = 0.533], and qSteatosis [r = 0.802]) and high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (qFibrosis [0.870‐0.951; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.787‐1.000; P < 0.001], qInflammation [0.820‐0.838; 95% CI, 0.726‐0.933; P < 0.001), qBallooning [0.813‐0.844; 95% CI, 0.708‐0.957; P < 0.001], and qSteatosis [0.939‐0.986; 95% CI, 0.867‐1.000; P < 0.001]) and was able to distinguish differing grades/stages of histological disease. Performance of qFIBS was best when assessing degree of steatosis and fibrosis, but performed less well when distinguishing severe inflammation and higher ballooning grades.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n","An abstract of assigned to cluster  9\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Fully coupled fluid-electro-mechanical model of the human heart for supercomputers In this work, we present a fully coupled fluid-electro-mechanical model of a 50th percentile human heart. The model is implemented on Alya, the BSC multi-physics parallel code, capable of running efficiently in supercomputers. Blood in the cardiac cavities is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme. Electrophysiology is modeled with a monodomain scheme and the O'Hara-Rudy cell model. Solid mechanics is modeled with a total Lagrangian formulation for discrete strains using the Holzapfel-Ogden cardiac tissue material model. The three problems are simultaneously and bidirectionally coupled through an electromechanical feedback and a fluid-structure interaction scheme. In this paper, we present the scheme in detail and propose it as a computational cardiac workbench.\n","\n","\n","Computational Methods Used in Hit-to-Lead and Lead Optimization Stages of Structure-Based Drug Discovery GPCR modeling approaches are widely used in the hit-to-lead (H2L) and lead optimization (LO) stages of drug discovery. The aims of these modeling approaches are to predict the 3D structures of the receptor-ligand complexes, to explore the key interactions between the receptor and the ligand and to utilize these insights in the design of new molecules with improved binding, selectivity or other pharmacological properties. In this book chapter, we present a brief survey of key computational approaches integrated with hierarchical GPCR modeling protocol (HGMP) used in hit-to-lead (H2L) and in lead optimization (LO) stages of structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). We outline the differences in modeling strategies used in H2L and LO of SBDD and illustrate how these tools have been applied in three drug discovery projects.\n","\n","\n","__________________________________________________\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vCSFsJMiG2he"},"source":["#### Document Embeddings from the Abstract,
